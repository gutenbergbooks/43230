<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />THE LAST ARROW</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson caught his breath as his
feet shot from beneath him and he plunged
into a rushing torrent of icy water. Thoughts
flashed across his mind, mental pictures of
homes and firesides. Echoes of laughter
sounded in his ears.</p>
<p>Yet in this wilderness there was no laughter
save the boisterous roar of an Arctic stream.
There were no homes save those of the muskrat,
the beaver and the white owl. The nearest
cabin was fifty miles or more back. An all but
impassable forest of scrub spruce, fir and pine
lay between. There was time for but a flash
back before Johnny found himself fighting for
his life against the torrent that was dragging
him over rocks and sunken logs, splashing,
ducking, pulling at him and threatening every
moment to make an end of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>But Johnny Thompson was not one to be
beaten at once by this rushing torrent of northern
Canada. Swimming strongly, warding off
overhanging branches here, dodging great
protruding boulders there, he still watched for
a gently shelving bank that might offer him
so much as a moment&rsquo;s rest. Since no such
haven offered itself at once, he shot the rapids
like a salmon.</p>
<p>A long, slender oiled canvas sack hung at
his back. Twice this threatened to prove his
undoing. It caught upon a tough willow
branch and dragged him beneath the surface.
Hardly had he freed himself than this same
sack that apparently contained some stiff and
stubborn affair of wood or steel caught in a
rocky crevice to throw him high and wide.
This involuntary pole vault left him with
breath quite crushed out, but still struggling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Suddenly, straight ahead, he caught sight of
that which must prove his salvation or his
undoing. Undermined by the torrent a green
spruce tree lay squarely across his path.</p>
<p>Ten seconds to wonder. Would he be
caught in the branches and drowned, or would
he mount those same branches to freedom?</p>
<p>Sixty seconds of terrific battle and the splendid
muscles of the boy won against relentless
nature. Panting, triumphant, he sat astride
the branches.</p>
<p>He was saved. There remained but to climb
back to land. He was cold and wet. A roaring
fire would remedy that. His blanket roll lay
where he had tossed it on this side of the
stream before he attempted to ford the treacherous
tumult of water. The way back to his
blankets would be rough going. He&rsquo;d manage
that.</p>
<p>But suddenly the smile on his face faded.
His eyes had fallen upon the long sack that
had hung at his back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;torn open by the
same branch. And they&rsquo;re gone, all gone but
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After adjusting the torn fastenings as best
he could, he worked his way over the swaying
tree trunk to solid earth. Then with sober
face, he began making his way back over the
rocks to the spot where his blanket roll lay.
The situation was a serious one.</p>
<p>An hour later he sat before a roaring campfire
of fir and balsam boughs. Dressed in a
change of clothing and wrapped in a blanket,
with his costume of an hour before sending
clouds of steam toward the sky, he might have
seemed the picture of contentment. He was
far from contented. Presently he removed a
small coffee pot from the fire and poured a cup
of dark brown liquid. The aroma of coffee
seemed good. He smiled. Then, without sugar
or cream, he gulped it down black and hot.
Nor did he eat after that. There was nothing
to eat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Had you chanced to look into his pack you
would have found there neither firearms nor
ammunition. The nearest cabin that he knew
of in all that vast northern wilderness was
fifty miles back over an ill-defined trail. That
cabin was deserted. He had slept there four
nights back.</p>
<p>So Johnny sat by the fire meditating, thinking
on matters of greater or less importance.
And as he meditated, at a point somewhat
more than a mile downstream, as the crow
flies, a figure appeared among the rocks that
kept the rushing stream in tumult.</p>
<p>A girl in her late teens, she moved out from
among dark pines into a patch of light. The
touches of sunset, lighting up her dark brown
hair and adding a touch of gold to her ruddy
freckled cheeks, transformed her for the moment
into a goddess of the forest.</p>
<p>Sensing the change, she stood motionless as
a statue for a full moment. Then, into that
glory of the sunset she smiled, and the smile
made her seem more alive than any wild thing
that had ever ventured to the brink of that
tumultuous stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>In her hand she held a rustic bucket. Its
handle, a thong of caribou sinew, its bottom
a circle of wood cut from some fallen spruce
tree, its sides white birchbark, this bucket
seemed a part of the wilderness.</p>
<p>As she stooped to fill the rustic bucket, her
eyes caught sight of some unusual object bobbing
up and down in the water.</p>
<p>One moment, a flash of red and gold, she
saw it. The next it was lost in a rush of foam.
In a twinkling the bucket was dropped among
the rocks and she went racing downstream in
hot pursuit.</p>
<p>A hundred yards, leaping from boulder to
boulder, she plunged onward until, red-cheeked,
panting, she came upon an eddy, a
still dark pool, twenty feet across, and at its
very center, moving serenely about, was the
coveted prize.</p>
<p>With the aid of the slow current and a long
dry pole, she succeeded at last in coaxing the
thing ashore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>As she grasped it, a trio of bright feathers
bound to a slender shaft came to view. She
caught her breath again. And as she pricked
her hand on the broad head sharp as a razor
at the other end of the shaft, her face lost some
of its heightened color.</p>
<p>Turning, she raced back to the spot where
the crude bucket still rested. There, without
pausing to complete her errand, she dashed up
the slope to a spot where a tumbled-down
cabin rested among the trees.</p>
<p>A man, very tall, very straight and quite old,
a bearded patriarch, rose at her approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather!&rdquo; she exclaimed, almost in a
whisper. &ldquo;We must leave this cabin at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man threw her a questioning look.
For answer she held up the arrow she had
found floating feather up in the stream.</p>
<p>Taking it from her, he examined it closely
in the waning light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White man,&rdquo; he pronounced at last, as if
reading from a book. &ldquo;Somewhat new at the
game, but possessed of a considerable knowledge
of the art. A very good arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must go up,&rdquo; he said after a moment of
silence. &ldquo;We will go up at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the cabin together. Some
twenty minutes later, with well arranged
packs on their backs, they emerged from the
shadowy interior to go marching briskly down
toward the banks of the rushing stream.
There they began leaping from rock to rock.
In this manner they traveled a considerable
distance without leaving a single tell-tale footprint
behind.</p>
<p>So they moved on into the twilight, a powerful
old man and a short, sturdy girl, marched
on into a wilderness that is acquainted only
with the voice of the wolf, the caribou and the
white owl.</p>
<p>Once as they paused for a moment&rsquo;s rest beside
a great flat rock, the girl removed some
object from her pack and held it up to the uncertain
light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; the old man rumbled. &ldquo;An
arrow, a well-shaped, well-constructed arrow
with a death-dealing steel point! Had it been
a shot gun shell, that would not have seemed
strange. But an arrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Grandfather, we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The girl stroked
a strong longbow that hung at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s smile was
good to see. &ldquo;But we are of a bygone race, at
least I am. This is 1928. Except for such as
we are, the bow and arrow are of the past.
But see!&rdquo; He started up. &ldquo;It is getting dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few yards farther down the strange pair
left the stream&rsquo;s bank to go clambering up a
rocky run. Even here they avoided snow. And
so, marching sturdily forward, they faded into
the gathering darkness and deep shadows of
pines.</p>
<p>You have perhaps guessed that the arrow
found bobbing its way downstream came from
Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s quiver. In fact at the very
moment when the old man and the girl left
the cabin, he was engaged in the task of oiling
two stout bows and waxing their strings. Having
done this, he looked sorrowfully at the single
broadhead arrow that remained in his
quiver, took one more long gulp of hot black
coffee, then set to wondering what lay before
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>To be facing a wilderness alone with bows
and arrows as one&rsquo;s sole means of securing
food might seem bad enough. To have but one
arrow; what could be worse? A missed shot,
a shattering rattle against the rocks, and this
arrow might be gone forever.</p>
<p>And then? Blunt arrows, sent crashing into
the side of resting rabbit or sleeping ptarmigan
would be as deadly as spear point when
fired from Johnny&rsquo;s sixty-pound bow. There
was wood all about for shafts. But what of
feathers and weights for the tips? One might
come upon a sleeping owl. Here would be
feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;I have not seen
a living thing for three days. The country is
deserted. But no, not quite. There was the
caribou track.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Ah, yes, that very afternoon he had come
upon the trail of a caribou. It had been this
very caribou that led him to disaster. The
beast had crossed the river. In attempting to
follow he had come near losing his life, and
had lost all but one of his arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;to-morrow my luck
will turn. A single arrow is enough for a caribou
and I am now on his side of the stream.
I will take up the trail in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, after replenishing his fire, he
rolled up in his blankets and prepared for a
night&rsquo;s repose.</p>
<p>Was it the coffee? Was it hunger? Or was
it the silence of the night in that strange land
that robbed him of coveted slumber? For long
his eyes remained closed. Yet sleep did not
come.</p>
<p>At last, yielding to the inevitable, he opened
his eyes wide to stare upward through sighing
pine branches to the infinite heavens above,
where a myriad stars twinkled and beamed as
they appeared to leap across tossing clusters
of pine needles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Like a story told by a poet, a picture thrown
on the screen, his life of the past few months
moved before him.</p>
<p>Arriving from dreamy tropical seas and deep
tangled swamps of Central America, he had in
late Autumn arrived at the mid-western city
which was inseparably linked with his childhood.</p>
<p>There, as he felt the crisp tang of autumn
mornings and caught the gleams of frost on
the corn, he felt again the lure of the North.</p>
<p>Months of hot tropical sun lay behind him.
He had come to loathe the soft warmth that
saps men&rsquo;s energies, thins their blood and
weakens their wills. He yearned now for the
long white trail, the screaming of sled runners,
the song of dogs that is an Arctic night.</p>
<p>But at this moment a fresh fancy seized him.
Burton Bronson, an old-time friend, had by
chance shown him a hunting bow with which
he had performed marvelous feats. The wolf,
the wild cat, mountain lion and bear had felt
the bite of his broadhead arrows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Johnny had been skeptical. Bronson had
demonstrated his power. Johnny had come to
believe. He was at once fascinated by this
new form of sport. The longbow, the arrow,
and wide open spaces took him in hand.</p>
<p>Long weeks they led him over sand dunes,
across broad prairies, through silent forests.</p>
<p>When weather became too bleak for out-of-doors
sport, he had retreated to the cover of
the North Shore Archery. There he had so
perfected his form that no small game was safe
from his straight speeding arrow.</p>
<p>Then it was that his longing for the North
returned. On top of this came the resolve to
stake his fortune for the immediate future on
his recently acquired skill. He would go into
the North with no other weapon than the bow
and arrow. With these alone, as the savages
had done before him, he would make his way
northward through Canada until, fortune attending
him, he should reach the headwaters
of the mighty Yukon in time to witness that
greatest of nature&rsquo;s panoramas, the Spring
breakup on the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>So here he was. Over many a long mile
Fate had been kind to him. Indians and white
men alike had treated him well. They had
laughed good-naturedly at his weapons, but
had admired the strength and skill he exhibited
in using them. The Indians of the first
trading post had dubbed him &ldquo;Johnny Longbow.&rdquo;
Johnny Longbow he was after that. He
was not ashamed of the nickname, nor the
things for which it stood.</p>
<p>Beside him now, there in the midst of the
great white wilderness, lay his two bows. One
was of yew wood, backed with calfskin thin as
parchment; the other an affair of his own making.
Carved from the hardest and toughest of
wood, osage orange, this bow was the pride
of his life. He loved and trusted it as a friend.
It had never failed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I had arrows for you!&rdquo; he whispered
now. &ldquo;But we will have that caribou
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he closed his eyes and fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Johnny Longbow&rsquo;s breakfast next morning
consisted of two cups of black coffee and a
handful of sour berries he found clinging to
their stems just as a premature winter had
found them.</p>
<p>Placing his pack in the crotch of a tree and
marking the spot well, he slung his handmade
osage bow across his back, thrust his lone arrow
sword-like through his belt, then marched
forth into the crisp glory of Arctic morning,
to seek out the lost trail of that lone caribou.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon when, with heart
pounding painfully against his ribs, he stood
neck deep among scrub spruce trees.</p>
<p>The scene before him was one to inspire an
artist&rsquo;s brush or lend fire to a poet&rsquo;s pen. A
young buck caribou, a superb creature of shining
brown and glistening black, stood before
him in a narrow circle of green. Walled in on
every side by dark young fir trees, the wild
creature&rsquo;s miniature pasture seemed to have
been planned by some famous director for the
setting of a scene in a wildwood drama.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>The caribou was feeding toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another minute, just one more,&rdquo; he told
himself.</p>
<p>His watch ticked loudly. It seemed certain
that the wild creature must hear. The snap of
a twig off to the right came near spoiling it all.
The caribou lifted its head. Johnny&rsquo;s unnerved
hand all but lost its grip on his bow.</p>
<p>The day&rsquo;s trail had been long and tiresome.
Over rocky slopes, down icy streams, across
treacherous snows, the caribou had led the way
until the boy, weak from lack of food, was near
to the point where one gives up in despair.
Twice, as if to tempt him, a snowshoe rabbit
leaped from his path, only to pause among the
rocks and stare at him. Twice he had strung
his bow, twice nocked his single arrow for a
shot. Twice he had told himself that a miss
among those rocks meant a shattered shaft,
that at most the rabbit offered but a meal or
two of indifferent food. Twice he had slipped
the arrow in his belt, had unstrung his bow
to take up the task of dogged tracking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be the caribou or nothing!&rdquo; he had
told himself. &ldquo;A month&rsquo;s provision, or famine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, here, just before him, feeding
peacefully, was the caribou. For the moment
he was well over at the far side of his narrow
pasture. A few moments more, and he would
be close enough for a sure shot, and then! The
boy caught his breath as he thought what the
speeding of that single arrow meant to him.</p>
<p>Closing his eyes, he saw himself, a load of
meat across his shoulders, beating his way
back to the last outpost of civilization where
were feathers, wood and steel for the making
of many arrows. Then again the picture went
dark. He saw the shadow of his present self,
struggling over long lost trails, eagerly sucking
bitter bark or grubbing into frozen earth
for some crude substance with which to allay
his hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must win!&rdquo; he told himself stoutly. &ldquo;I
must not miss!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>And still, as the moments passed, as the
caribou moved nearer and nearer, the zero hour
came closer to hand, he found his faith wavering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One arrow,&rdquo; he thought over and over,
&ldquo;only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But &ldquo;Now! Now!&rdquo; he breathed at last.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the antlered monarch of the far north
raised his head to stand there silent, listening,
still as a statue, Johnny&rsquo;s bow twanged, his
arrow sped.</p>
<p>With a bound high and free the wild creature
leaped away.</p>
<p>One, two, three bounds, and he had cleared
the spot of light green. Another, another and
yet another, he went thrashing breast deep in
the young firs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missed!&rdquo; Johnny groaned. &ldquo;Missed! And
he carries into the forest my only arrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? Just as his head fell in
dejection he saw the caribou make one more
leap, high and wide, then come to a sudden
stand. Still breast deep in darkest green, he
appeared to view the scene before another wild
dash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for one more arrow!&rdquo; the boy groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no other, so what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the forlorn hope that his lone arrow
might by chance have glanced and fallen on
the green, he moved toward the narrow circle
of wild pasture.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he stood still. There had
come to his sensitive ear a sound of movement
in the brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the caribou either,&rdquo; he told himself as
his heart skipped a beat. &ldquo;Some wild beast of
prey, a bear or a wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no, a greater surprise awaited him. Before
him, much closer to the caribou than to
him, a khaki clad back appeared. A boyish
head, an old cap, a pair of stout arms held high,
a bow, a quiver of arrows. A second&rsquo;s suspense,
and an arrow flew straight and fair at
the statuesque caribou.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; Johnny told himself, rubbing
his eyes. &ldquo;This is Nineteen Twenty-eight.
Strange enough for me to be here. But a girl
with only a bow and arrow in these wilds? It
can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet it was. As he looked again the girl
was still there. So too was the caribou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two arrows, and still he stands there motionless.
That creature, this place is bewitched.
I&rsquo;ll break the spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to lift his voice in a loud
&ldquo;hello&rdquo; when the girl, turning half about, fitted
a second arrow to her bow and let fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight to the mark, as I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny spoke his thought out loud. &ldquo;And
still he stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl wheeled about to stare at him in
blank surprise. Then, as surprise and fear left
her, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beast is surely charmed! I&rsquo;ve shot him,
and yet he does not stir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the shining black antlers sank low.
The whole head of the caribou disappeared in
the brush. Still his body remained erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery here!&rdquo; Johnny sprang forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>The girl, as if in fear of losing the prize,
started forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s yours.
I missed him fair enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you missed?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s tone
showed surprise.</p>
<p>Johnny did not hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery solved!&rdquo; he shouted back a moment
later. &ldquo;When he made that last leap he
landed so squarely on the tops of a half dozen
young fir trees that they did what his legs no
longer could. They supported him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer. Come
here, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girl advanced he had time for a brief
study of her fine, strong, khaki clad figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen or twenty. English or Scotch.
An outdoor girl,&rdquo; was his mental comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Question is,&rdquo; he smiled as the girl came
close, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s caribou is it? Three arrows, all
quite near the heart. Two are yours, one
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;yours?&rdquo; The puzzled look of a moment
before returned to the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I shot first. You did not see me. But
there&rsquo;s my arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But really,&rdquo; his tone changed as the girl
seemed suddenly crestfallen, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no need
of mine and thine in the forest. I am glad as
I can be to know that there&rsquo;s a fellow creature
near. That was my last arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look hungry,&rdquo; she said suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, a little. Haven&rsquo;t really eaten for&mdash;well,
for some time. Luck went against me.
Couldn&rsquo;t even get a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the caribou to camp,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a half mile, all down grade. Grandfather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off quite suddenly as one does
who has found himself in danger of saying too
much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you have a camp of your own&mdash;&rdquo; she
hesitated, &ldquo;perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; Again she paused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>As Johnny watched, he read in her face
signs of conflicting emotions. Native hospitality,
a longing for companionship, youth calling
to youth, were battling with fear. This
much he understood. But why the fear? She
had spoken of a grandfather. Surely then
there could be no objection to his joining them
in a feast off the venison they had secured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she began again. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; extending
her quiver filled with arrows, &ldquo;take
these. We have others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dress the deer and we&rsquo;ll divide it,&rdquo; said
Johnny, exasperated by what seemed to him
cool effrontery. He did not so much as look at
the proffered arrows.</p>
<p>Hanging her quiver on a spruce bough, the
girl assisted him in lifting the caribou to a
strong bough and stringing him up. It was
then that Johnny came to know of her superb
strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a man,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>She sat watching in silence as he performed
his task. When, however, he had dressed the
deer, severed its head from its body and was
studying the problem of a fair division without
an axe or butcher&rsquo;s cleaver, she spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift the fore parts to my shoulder,&rdquo; she
said quietly. &ldquo;I think we can carry it to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That she had arrived at some decision as he
worked Johnny guessed. What decision, and
why? This he did not know.</p>
<p>The girl led the way. The going was rough.
More than once she slipped and all but fell.
Yet each time her recovery was that of the
perfect woodsman, like the spring of a creature
made of steel. Once she fell forward, and the
caribou dropped to earth. Before Johnny
could come to her aid she was up with a low
laugh and lifted the burden to her shoulder
once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not quite sure what it was he hoped.
He had been a long time in the wilderness, had
been facing starvation, too. He had not realized
until this moment how bleak and lonely
it had been.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were broken short off by the
girl&rsquo;s actions. She had come to a sudden stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop&mdash;drop it down here.&rdquo; Her words
came uncertainly.</p>
<p>Johnny obeyed. The next instant she had
disappeared into the brush that surrounded
them on every side, nor had he seen which way
she had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>Dismay overtook him. She might not return.
There was something altogether strange
about the whole affair. But half a caribou in a
wilderness! Yes, she would return. So he sat
down to wait, and as he waited, there came to
him, wafted along by a gentle breeze, faint
odors of campfire smoke and bacon frying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />MYSTERIOUS FEAR</h2>
<p>In spite of his great hunger and the maddening
odors that came to him, filling his heart
with a wild desire to break his promise, to wait
no longer, but dash into the strange camp,
Johnny had fallen into a doze when the girl,
silent as a snow bunting, returned.</p>
<p>She touched his arm. He jumped, stared
blinkingly, then smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are American,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know much of Canada?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much. Been over the border a
month; came in from the northwest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Grandfather. Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made as if to take up her share of the
burden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>With a quick move Johnny threw the entire
weight of the caribou squarely across his own
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She led the way in silence. Carefully pushing
the branches aside, indicating by a downward
glance a spot where the footing was uncertain,
testing a half rotted log and rejecting
it as treacherous, she played the part of a perfect
guide until, with an air of finality, she
parted the spruce branches to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Johnny lowered his burden to the earth
he found himself astonished at the sight before
him. He had expected to see a hunter&rsquo;s lodge
of some proportions, at least a homeseeker&rsquo;s
cabin in fair state of preservation. Instead he
found a mere lodge built of poles, bark and
boughs. Walled in on three sides, with one
side open to the campfire, it formed but a temporary
abode.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can these people be doing in such a
place and so far from the haunts of man?&rdquo; he
asked himself.</p>
<p>He was destined to ask that question many
times in the weeks that were to come.</p>
<p>But now his thoughts were broken off. The
girl was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather, this is the young man,&rdquo; she
said simply as she nodded toward Johnny.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bringing his own venison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had a hand in it,&rdquo; said Johnny modestly
as a great, grizzled six-foot Scotchman,
stooping low that he might pass out of the
lodge, gave him a smile and offered a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He killed the caribou.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s laugh
was low and pleasing. &ldquo;After he had killed
him I shot him twice just to make sure he was
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in a few words she narrated the
adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather strange,&rdquo; the big Scot rumbled.
&ldquo;But see here, young man, you are an American,
are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then how is it that you are hunting with
bow and arrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit of a fad, I suppose,&rdquo; said Johnny,
not wishing to overplay his part. &ldquo;But even
in America we feel that some traditions and
arts should be preserved. There&rsquo;s a lot of sport
in really shooting straight and true with one
of man&rsquo;s most ancient weapons. Don&rsquo;t you
think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; the old man&rsquo;s answer was emphatic.
&ldquo;And, furthermore, I believe the world would
be better off if it had never smelled gunpowder.
We as a generation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Grandfather,&rdquo; the girl broke in, &ldquo;he
has not eaten for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&mdash;nearly,&rdquo; Johnny admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be time for talking by the evening
campfire. Faye, bring out the broiler.
I&rsquo;ll stir up the fire. We&rsquo;ll have you a broiled
venison steak you&rsquo;ll not soon forget.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Inside the cabin by the door you&rsquo;ll find a
basin,&rdquo; the old man went on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s water
in the brook and soap in the little box under
the eaves. In the north woods one lives the
simple life. But you&rsquo;re welcome to such as we
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corn cakes fried in bacon grease, a rich,
juicy steak broiled over the coals, made the
feast all that Gordon Duncan, the old Scot,
had promised it should be.</p>
<p>The meal over, pine chips that had been used
in lieu of plates were tossed into the fire, aluminum
cups, spoons and forks were cleansed at
the brook, then for a space of time the three
sat silently contemplating the fire.</p>
<p>As he had entered the shelter in search of
the basin, Johnny had allowed his eyes to rove
about the place. In one corner, tightly rolled
up and tied with thongs, were two sleeping
bags. In another stood a canvas receptacle
which, he concluded, must contain bows and
arrows. A single bow of powerful proportions
stood against the back wall. Not a single firearm
of any sort was in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; he had thought to himself. &ldquo;Our
meeting seems to have been arranged by some
great director of destinies. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was thinking now of the uncertainty and
great secrecy that had attended his entrance
to their inner circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can one fear up here?&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>At once the answer came back, &ldquo;The law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who has not read of the far reaching arm of
the law in this land, the Mounted Police?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can they be fugitives from justice?&rdquo; The
thing seemed absurd. And yet?</p>
<p>As he sat by the fire, now watching its leaping
flames and now staring into the mystery
haunted darkness that lay all about him, he
wondered anew, but most of all he listened,
waiting for a word that would bid him join
them here in the heart of the wilderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>He realized as never before how lonely life
in the Arctic could become, how uncertain
life&rsquo;s span. He had been on the verge of starvation.
Now he was fed. His arrow, shot into
the heart of the caribou, had not been broken.
He had salvaged that. It lay close beside
him. Yet this was his only arrow. There had
been a little thawing of snow on sunny slopes,
but winter was still here. The low swish and
sigh of the pines suggested a cold wind from
the north with a possible blizzard. To be alone
in such a storm, with but a single arrow&mdash;</p>
<p>As if reading the boy&rsquo;s thought, the old
man spoke. &ldquo;We can offer you little protection
and no bed, but you are welcome to a
place before our fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got blankets.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was
eager as he sprang to his feet. The smile he
had seen on the girl&rsquo;s face returned. He
believed that she too was pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a great pal,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Strong
as a man. And how she can shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Gordon Duncan he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for my
blankets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you know the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s by a bend in the river where three great
pines shade the stream.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know the place,&rdquo; said the girl, springing
up. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take you as far as the river. You&rsquo;ll
have no trouble after that. There&rsquo;s something
of a trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they left the narrow circle of
golden light cast by the campfire and plunged
into black shadows.</p>
<p>As her eyes became accustomed to the
darkness, the girl appeared to experience no
difficulty in following the mere suggestion of
a trail that led down the hillside. Johnny noted
the habit she had acquired of leaping from
rock to rock and avoiding snowbanks. Hardly
knowing why, he followed her example.</p>
<p>As they came to the bank of the rushing
stream that even the winter&rsquo;s cold could not
conquer, they paused for a moment to watch
the moonlight play across its surface.</p>
<p>The girl moved quite close to him. Their
shoulders nearly touched. He seemed to feel
the splendid strength, the abounding life that
was in her. She somehow seemed a part of it
all, of the forest, the night and the rushing
river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
you&rsquo;ve come. I&mdash;I hope you&rsquo;ll like us. Grandfather
is a little queer, and he has bad spells
with his heart. And&mdash;and we can&rsquo;t go back,
not&mdash;not just yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your trail.&rdquo; Her voice changed suddenly.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get lost. But if you do,
just cup your hands and shout like this: &lsquo;Whoo
Hoo.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice rose clear and penetrating above
the rush of the river. An owl rose from a nearby
tree and went flapping away. There was
a scratching of feet on the hard packed snow.
From above came the answering boom of the
old man&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>She was gone.</p>
<p>Johnny turned to hurry on his way. Still
his mind was not all on the uncertain trail.
She had said they could not go back, not just
yet. &ldquo;Go back to what?&rdquo; he asked himself.
&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; Surely it was strange. Yet he
was very sure he was going to like them. He&rsquo;d
go where they went. Why not? He was adventuring,
living in the wilderness with bow
and arrow. Curious they should be doing the
same thing. Yes, he&rsquo;d go with them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>An hour of difficult tracking and he was at
his camp of the night before. Feeling not the
least desire to loiter here, he slung his pack
across his back and went trudging away toward
that other camp.</p>
<p>As he neared a certain spot on the river
trail, the moonlight seeping down through the
overhanging boughs showed him footprints
leading up the slope. It took but a single
glance to enable him to recognize them. They
had been made by the girl&rsquo;s moccasins.</p>
<p>Curiosity led him to follow this fresh trail.
In a space of three minutes he was at the door
of the substantial cabin, deserted but the day
before by the girl and the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were living here. They left this for
a temporary shelter. I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read the answer. They had discovered
that some person besides themselves was in the
country. How had they made the discovery?
Why were they afraid?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time unravels all mysteries,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Enough for to-night that I have found
human companions and a place beside a campfire.&rdquo;
He returned down the slope. A half
hour later, he was lying propped by one elbow
against his blanket roll, staring at the campfire
of his newfound friends. A little way from
him sat the girl.</p>
<p>On his return she had greeted him with one
of those rare smiles. That was about all. Ten
minutes passed into eternity as they sat there
in silence, encircled by the dark mysteries of
night and brooded over by the hush of a
wilderness.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s mind was never idle. It was busy
now. He was asking himself questions. Who
was this girl, so ruddy and strong? And who
was her grandfather? Had they always lived
thus in the wilds, supporting themselves with
bow and arrow alone? His fancy pictured
them so; yet reason told him it could not be
true. Why were they afraid? Afraid of being
discovered? Whom did they fear?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;it is evident
that they no longer fear me. I am from the
United States and have not been long in Canada.
That is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half formed resolve entered his mind, a
resolve that was to gain in strength as the
days passed. He would not leave the company
of this strange pair until he had solved
the mystery that hung over them like a ghostly
fog in the night.</p>
<p>The fire burned low. The north wind swept
in sharp and chilling. Rising, he took a small
axe that lay close by and went into the outer
darkness. The girl rose and followed silently.</p>
<p>Soon they returned, dragging heavy pine
logs after them. He had noted with admiration
that she chose a log as large and heavy as his
own.</p>
<p>Three times they retreated into the darkness;
three times returned heavily laden. Then,
each working at the end of a log, they replenished
the fire. Logs were piled high. Small
branches were thrown on. As the fire leaped
up the girl spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nowhere in particular. Just bumming,
you might say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him in a peculiar way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said half apologetically, &ldquo;it
wasn&rsquo;t exactly that. Been in the North before,
but not with bow and arrow; not Canada
either. Alaska. The North called me back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Her voice was low and deep.
&ldquo;It always does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the bow,&rdquo; he spoke again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
mere novice. But there&rsquo;s a charm to such hunting
that does not come with firearms. And
these primeval forests always have seemed to
call to me. The wilderness has voices, a thousand
voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the dare that nature threw down
to me,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;and here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your arrows? You had only one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lost the others yesterday in the river. It
was deeper and swifter than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, she went into the birchbark cabin.
She returned at once with an arrow. She held
it out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I believe is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny in great surprise. &ldquo;You
found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came bobbing along to me on the surface
of the river. It&rsquo;s a fine arrow. I&rsquo;ve asked the
fairies of this northwood to bless it. Take it
back; it may bring you good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny broke off abruptly. He
was about to say, &ldquo;So that is how you knew
I was near?&rdquo; He would make no attempt to
surprise these new friends into divulging their
strange secret. No. He would try to prove
himself worthy of their friendship and confidence.</p>
<p>As if conscious of that which went on within
his mind, the girl lapsed again into silence.</p>
<p>When at last she spoke again her tones were
deep and mellow like the low notes of a cello.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather and I,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have gone
into the woods every year since I was ten.
The bow and arrow are his hobby. They have
become mine. He never uses firearms. He has
dreadfully sensitive ears. The explosion of a
shotgun drives him frantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always before,&rdquo; she went on after a pause,
&ldquo;we have come to the wilderness for pure
pleasure, the joy of the out-of-doors. But this
year&mdash;&rdquo; She paused again as if for reflection.
&ldquo;This year we have gone farther than before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny caught his breath. He had thought
she was about to reveal a secret, and didn&rsquo;t
more than half want to hear it. A mystery
half ripened is no mystery at all. He need not
have feared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we will go farther
north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The word slipped out unguarded.</p>
<p>She looked at him in silence, then said quite
calmly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, not quite all together.
This year Grandfather acts quite
strangely. He tells me he sees signs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t tell me that. Perhaps he
doesn&rsquo;t quite know. He is very old; yet his
mind is bright, clear as a bell. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl put out a hand to touch
Johnny&rsquo;s lips. She had caught a sound that
had escaped him. The old man was returning.
Ten seconds later he came tramping in through
the brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is splendid,&rdquo; he beamed. &ldquo;Been
five miles downstream. The trail is good.
Country is opening up. To-morrow we will go
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he sighed as he dropped on a bed of
pine needles. &ldquo;You know how to make a fire,
you two. It feels good!&rdquo; He rubbed his hands
together with great satisfaction.</p>
<p>That night, ere he made up his bed of pine
needles before the fire and rolled up in his
blanket for a few hours of perfect repose,
Johnny witnessed a curious and impressive
ceremony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>As they sat there before the fire, the three
of them, Gordon Duncan took from his pocket
a small, well worn volume. After thumbing
its pages for a moment, he found a place and
began to read. The words of a very ancient
poet, who had learned centuries ago to place
his trust in a power that was higher and
greater than all earthly things, came from the
lips of the venerable Scot like a benediction.</p>
<p>When at last he closed the book and lifted
his voice in petition, it was as if they were
savages, children of nature, an old man, a girl
and a boy, as if the earth were new again and
they were asking the All Seeing One to send
caribou, rabbit and ptarmigan, to withhold the
cunning of the wolf and the power of the bear,
to hold the bitter north wind in check and
send the gentle south wind to fan their cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>When it was over, when the old man and
the girl had retired to their frail shelter for the
night, and Johnny had wrapped himself in
blankets before the fire of pine logs, he felt
within him a glow of warmth and a sense of
security such as he had not experienced before
in all his wanderings.</p>
<p>The next day a strange discovery was made.
A fresh mystery pressed itself upon them. In
the unraveling of this mystery, Faye Duncan
was to take a fair part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />THE KNIFE IN THE TREE</h2>
<p>Next morning as they sat munching corn
bread and strips of caribou broiled on the coals,
Gordon Duncan put down his coffee cup and
turned to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;in the home of
my childhood on the crags of the Scottish
Highlands, the word stranger spelled welcome.
Here we have no home worthy of the name.
Even this we are leaving for the unknown that
lies just beyond. Your way leads down the
river; or if you can so shape your course that
it may be so, we would be glad to have you
join us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>There was a gentleness and a warmth in the
old man&rsquo;s tone that went to the boy&rsquo;s heart.
Before making reply, however, he turned toward
the girl. At once he was rewarded by
that frank and friendly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going nowhere in particular,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I am thankful for human companionship,
more thankful than I can tell. Yesterday I
was in a bad way. It may be that you have
come between me and starvation. I should be
ungrateful indeed did I not remain with you
with a hope that I might in some way repay
your kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; in Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s eyes
shone a gleam of light, &ldquo;in this world one seldom
repays a kindness, an act of courtesy or a
friendly lift along the way, but one may always
pass it on to some other member of the great
human family. He&mdash;but we are talking too
long. The trail beckons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Packs were soon made. Johnny was surprised
at the lightness of the sleeping bags
used by his friends. &ldquo;Scarcely five pounds
apiece,&rdquo; he told himself. Bacon, cornmeal,
coffee, a few dried beans, three cans of condensed
milk, such was the food supply of these
wanderers. Each took in his pack as much
caribou as he could comfortably carry. When
Johnny saw that the girl proposed to carry a
full third of the load, he offered to carry her
caribou meat.</p>
<p>As she received his offer, her face flushed
and her lips parted as if with a quick retort.
Then, seeming to sense the spirit in which the
offer was made, she allowed those same lips
to open in a friendly smile as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am used to the load. Without it I should
not be hungry at noontime. It is enough if
you break trail for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny soon realized the truth of this last
remark. The effect of the slight thaw of two
days before was gone. The snow on the sloping
hillside, hard packed as it was by many
an Arctic blast, offered a surface so smooth
and hard that more than once his feet shot
from beneath him and he went speeding
straight down to the gentler slopes a hundred
feet below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>To avoid following his example the old man
with his hunting knife cut steps across the
perilous places.</p>
<p>Noon found them nearing a clump of pines.
As they came close to it, some object quite
like a rolling ball of snow moved swiftly before
them.</p>
<p>At once Faye&rsquo;s pack was off her shoulder
and her stout arms stringing her bow as she
whispered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birds. Ptarmigan. A whole covey of
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next moment she and Johnny were off in
swift pursuit.</p>
<p>After a half hour&rsquo;s exciting chase, they returned
with four of these white quail of the
Arctic. To Johnny&rsquo;s chagrin, Faye had out-shot
him three to one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not used to these birds,&rdquo; she
said generously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn soon enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>The days were growing long. There seemed
little reason for haste. For, where were they
going, after all? They took time to build a
fire and prepare a hearty meal. The birds they
saved for supper. For the present they feasted
on caribou meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan, &ldquo;to build
up muscle, fat and bone while you may. So
you will be able in the time of want to withstand
the pangs of hunger. Savage people
everywhere know this. We in our sleek complacency
of plenty too soon forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was mid-afternoon when the thing happened
which was destined to change the entire
order of their lives and carry them away on a
mad quest that might well end in disaster and
death.</p>
<p>It often happens as one travels along life&rsquo;s
pathway that he comes of a sudden to that
which is to change the very nature of his being.
But does he know it? More often than otherwise
he does not. It was even so now. As the
wandering trio came over the crest of a ridge
and began to descend into a valley down a narrow
run that led them back to the river, they
saw before them a scraggy pine of unusual
height. Surrounded as it was by a low
growth of cottonwoods, it seemed a beacon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>To one member of the party it was a beacon.
Hardly had Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s eyes fallen upon
it than he suddenly pressed a hand to his forehead
to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tree! As I live! The very tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Grandfather! What&mdash;&rdquo; The girl
looked at him in alarm.</p>
<p>He was gone. Leading on at a pace that
was hard to follow, he headed directly for the
lone pine.</p>
<p>Once there, he dropped on hands and knees
to point at some object protruding from the
gnarled trunk of the giant tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The knife!&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;The knife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he fell backward, panting for breath.</p>
<p>All the splendid color left Faye Duncan&rsquo;s
cheeks as she bent over his prostrate form and
began struggling with the buttons of his
mackinaw and shirt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his heart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
much we can do. He&rsquo;ll come round presently.
But some day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish, but the wrinkles that
came in her brow told all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does it mean?&rdquo; said Johnny pointing
to the hilt of a hunting knife that protruded
a short two inches from the trunk of
the pine. &ldquo;Must have been there twenty years.
A few years more and it would have been completely
buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Faye Duncan knew what that knife meant
and why it had stirred up such violent emotions
in her grandfather&rsquo;s breast, she did not
say so. She sat staring at the thing that had
brought tragedy so near.</p>
<p>Giving up the problem, Johnny kindled a
small fire, then put water on to boil for coffee.</p>
<p>Presently the old man sat up to stare dully
about him. The instant his eyes fell upon the
knife hilt they were alight once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-one years!&rdquo; he muttered, pressing
his forehead once more. &ldquo;Twenty-one years!
All these years, and now I have found it&mdash;perhaps
too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he began fumbling at an inside coat
pocket. In the end he drew forth a small
square packet. Having unrolled a wad of thin
oiled cloth, he unfolded a square of soft white
skin. On this, done perhaps in pencil and later
traced with India ink, were many lines and
strangely shaped figures. Here and there
words were written.</p>
<p>Drawn involuntarily to his side, the boy and
girl stared at the map with surprised and eager
eyes.</p>
<p>Johnny read words written there: &ldquo;The
river,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mountains,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pass,&rdquo; &ldquo;The cabin,&rdquo;
he read. And last, but not least, &ldquo;Green Gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently quite unconscious of their presence,
the old man placed a trembling finger on
a certain spot and mumbled:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are here. The trail leads downstream,
four miles perhaps. The river forks there. We
cross the river below the fork, and ascend the
upper fork. The trail leads over the mountains.
The cabin lies beyond the mountain, the cabin
and green gold. A mine of green gold. That
was Timmie&rsquo;s dream. But then, perhaps he
was mad. But there was green gold, quantities
of it, and so heavy, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up and for the first time became
conscious of Faye and Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found the tree,&rdquo; he said simply, as
if they should know all about it. &ldquo;The trail
leads downstream a little way, then across
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the haunted look in her eyes, Johnny read
that Faye Duncan knew little regarding the
strange turn affairs had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his heart,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;We must
keep him quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said to Gordon Duncan, &ldquo;the trail
leads downstream. We will take it to-morrow.
For the night we will camp beneath this
friendly old giant of a tree and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rest!&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan, a great weariness
overtaking him. &ldquo;Rest. That&rsquo;s what we
need. And then,&rdquo; with a fresh eagerness, &ldquo;then
the long, long trail. Green gold it was, green
like the copper in the bed of the stream, but
gold, real gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny assisted in arranging a comfortable
resting place for him, then he nursed his small
fire along until it was a laughing, roaring
young conflagration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trail leads downstream and across the
river,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;Fine chance!&rdquo;
He could catch the rush of waters a hundred
yards away. That was the river. He had tried
crossing that rushing torrent once, and had
come near losing his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never again!&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Unless in
a boat. And where in all this wild land does
one get so much as a birchbark canoe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if reading his thoughts the old man sat
up quite suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere down the river,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
land slopes away into low hills. Here the river
is less rapid. It freezes over. If we get there
before the breakup, we may cross on the ice.
But that,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is a long, long trail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />GREEN GOLD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A long, long trail.&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s words
echoed in Johnny&rsquo;s ears as half an hour later,
he sat before the fire of great glowing logs.
Chilled by the cold and the dark, warmed by
the golden glow of human companionship, he
sat there half asleep, when the girl spoke.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, her words echoed his
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long, long trail,&rdquo; she was saying in a
tone that was resonant with mystery and
longing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has come upon something,&rdquo; she said
after a moment of silence, &ldquo;from out his past.&rdquo;
She turned to nod at the rude brush shelter
beneath which, deep in his sleeping bag, the
old man slumbered. Worn out by excitement
and his sudden heart attack, he had yielded to
his granddaughter&rsquo;s entreaties, and retired
early.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>As for the girl and the boy, nothing was
further from their thought than sleep. They
had come to a valley of decision. This they
knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will go,&rdquo; the girl said, glancing again
at the sleeping one. &ldquo;That trail has to do with
his past. More than twenty years ago, with a
partner called Timmie, he went into these
mountains prospecting. I know little enough
about it. What I know my mother told me.
She&rsquo;s dead now; been dead eight years. He
is all I have, and I am his only grandchild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, save for the little circle of light
sent out by the campfire, all was darkness.
Save for the snap and crack of burning logs,
all was silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>A light wind stirred the branches of the
giant pine beneath which they had camped.
As if endeavoring to tell the secret of the hunting
knife buried deep in its heart, it sighed
and whispered with the breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came back once, my mother told me,&rdquo;
the girl went on at last. &ldquo;It was a whole year
later. Someone found him wandering in the
forest. He was snow-blind and delirious. In
the long weeks of sickness that followed he
babbled of Timmie, of a mine of green gold,
and of a knife driven into a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the giant pine,
&ldquo;is the tree. It must be. And that is the knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of Timmie? What of green
gold?&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I only know,&rdquo; she said
slowly, &ldquo;that he will go all the way over that
long, long trail. It is his last great adventure.
He may not live to complete it. There is his
heart. He may&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She became silent. Cupping her chin in her
hands, she stared at the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said at last, without
changing her position, &ldquo;our home is a wonderful
place. It&rsquo;s only a cottage. But a cottage
may be quite wonderful. In summer vines
grow all over it, and old fashioned roses bloom
by its side. The song sparrow, quite unafraid,
builds her nest in the vines and squirrels come
from the woods to sit on our doorstep. It&rsquo;s
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She repeated the word softly, &ldquo;Home.
Nothing in the world could be more wonderful
than a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again silence, and the night closed in upon
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are thinking,&rdquo; said the girl at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of you and of your grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather is well worthy of your
thoughts. He gave his two sons to his country.
The war, that terrible war! They never
came back. One was my father. I&mdash;I think my
mother died of grief. But Grandfather, he just
carried on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Yes, Johnny believed Gordon Duncan
worthy of his thoughts. For the moment, however,
he was thinking of the girl, following
her in his mind&rsquo;s eye over that long, long trail
marked out on Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s map; saw
her making her way forward staunchly, fearlessly
into the great unknown with an old man
as her only companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then death overtakes her grandfather,&rdquo;
he whispered to himself.</p>
<p>He tried to picture her making her way
alone, back over those endless perilous miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; he told himself again.</p>
<p>A sudden resolve brought him sitting bolt
upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That green gold interests me,&rdquo; he said in
as quiet a tone as he could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe there is such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read incredulity in the girl&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger things have been discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden the meaning of his words came
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hand was on his arm, her eyes searching
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing more worth while to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed, and again, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; He
felt the pressure of her hand on his arm, that
was all.</p>
<p>For a long time after that there was silence.</p>
<p>The next day they took up that long, long
trail, and the day following saw one member
of the party very near to the end of all trails.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />A MAD MOOSE</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson was tired. He was hungry,
and was feeling down on his luck. He
had hunted the rugged hills since early morning,
yet no game had gone into his bag save
one great white owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where Faye is?&rdquo; he thought to
himself. &ldquo;Hoped I&rsquo;d meet her on this ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still hoped this. It was a long, lonely
tramp back to camp, and he was a sociable
being. Besides, he felt rather sure that she,
like himself, had met with little luck, and
misery loves company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>On the morning of that second day after
the momentous decision they found themselves
below the fork of the river, standing on the
bank of a tumultuous stream. Beyond this ice-rimmed
torrent lay Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s promised
land. How were they to bridge the chasm?
It seemed certain that Gordon Duncan was
right. Once the stream left the high, rocky
hills, its mad rush must be abated. They might
then cross upon the ice, or at least on a raft.</p>
<p>But their supply of provisions was low. The
way was long. Gordon Duncan was not yet
restored to his full strength. Having found
a rocky shelf walled in by nature on three
sides, they decided to give the day over to
hunting. Gordon Duncan would make camp
and prepare a supply of wood. Johnny and
the girl would hunt with bow and arrow. The
ground seemed suited for the chase. Here and
there were treeless spots overgrown with blueberry
bushes. Where the wind had swept
the snow, frozen berries clung stubbornly to
their stems. Ptarmigan might be feeding here.
Willow bushes close to the river bank showed
fresh markings done by snowshoe rabbits.
Once during the previous day they had
chanced upon a spot where a caribou had come
gliding down a steep slope to swim the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may have recrossed lower down,&rdquo;
Johnny had said.</p>
<p>So they had gone hunting, the two of them,
but not together. A narrow run led away to
the left from their camp. It was agreed that
Johnny should take the left slope of this run
and Faye the right. They might meet on the
ridge above.</p>
<p>Since he was ready first, Johnny had struck
out alone up the slope. He had heard nothing,
seen nothing of the girl all day.</p>
<p>Little game had come his way. Once a
ptarmigan had gone fluttering out from a
clump of blueberries. He had lost himself at
once in tall brush. A great white owl hooted
at him. He had bagged him at once, not for
food, but because of his broad feathers. He
must make more arrows. There was an
abundance of wood. Gordon Duncan had
offered him steel points. He must provide his
own feathers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>The land where he stood was rough, rocky
and rolling. In places dark tamarack stood so
thick in the narrow bottoms that it was impossible
to pass. To his amazement, as he
stood there looking, listening, the sound of a
tremendous tearing and thrashing suddenly
smote his startled senses. No sound came to
him save the crashing of brush and rending
of branches, yet even as he looked he caught
a gleam of bright red among the tamarack
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he told himself, involuntarily
tightening his grip on the six foot bow.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be a bird. Too big. I&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s going
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching at a branch here, another there,
without a sound he let himself down the slope.
As he dropped lower the spot of color was lost
to his view. This did not disturb him. His
sense of location was splendid. A tree taller
than its fellows, a branch twisted off by some
storm, a pine squirrel&rsquo;s nest, these were his
beacons. If he needed further guidance, the
surprising tumult continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Then of a sudden as he rounded a clump of
trees he saw it all at a glance. With a checked
cry of surprise he stepped swiftly back to grip
his bow and draw an arrow.</p>
<p>His movement was not missed. For a space
of ten seconds silence reigned in that bit of
northern wild. Then, as his bow sang taut
a red-eyed fury, a giant of that wilderness, a
bull moose, plunged head on, straight at him
as he crouched for a shot.</p>
<p>A bull moose, interrupted in his display of
anger, is a terrible creature to behold. As the
boy looked into his bloodshot eyes, as he took
in at once his huge head, his broad spiked
antlers, his powerful neck, he wondered about
his chances for life, and in the flash of a second
knew as never before what a glorious possession
life was. Yet he did not waver for an instant.
Another life was at stake, the life of
one without means of defense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>In that tense ten seconds before the moose
charged he had seen that which caused him to
doubt the accuracy of his vision. The flaming
red spot in the top of the young tamarack tree
was a red sweater worn by Faye Duncan. He
had not seen that sweater before. She had
worn a gray mackinaw in their travels.</p>
<p>But now, still crouching, he waited his shot.
It must be well aimed, back of the shoulder,
a perfect shot, or&mdash;</p>
<p>Twang! The arrow flew. The next instant,
with agility born of long training, he dropped
sideways and backward. He was not a second
too soon. The terrible impact of that powerful
head, the awful rending of those spiked
antlers; what chance had a boy against these?</p>
<p>With all the force and fury of a crazed elephant,
the moose went thundering straight on.</p>
<p>With his senses reeling, the boy fought his
way into a standing position in the tangle of
briars and young trees, then drew another
arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>It was well that he found himself so prepared,
for the moose, having checked himself
in his mad career, turned and charged again.
This time, only Providence could have saved
him. Enmeshed as he was in the underbrush,
he was in no position to dodge. A small tree,
directly between him and the charging terror,
saved him.</p>
<p>Blinded by rage, the moose charged straight
into the tree. The sound of the impact was
like the dropping of a pile driver. The stout
tree snapped off at the roots. But the great
beast was stopped.</p>
<p>It was enough. Again the bow twanged. A
moment later the giant moose lay beating the
brush in his death throes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny said, turning to the girl,
who by this time had climbed down from the
tree, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I call close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look on her sunbrowned face was deeply
serious. &ldquo;Yes, it was. I am sorry to put you
in such grave danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; he said, shrugging. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
great. I could have climbed a tree. Then there
would have been two of us.&rdquo; He laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The look on the girl&rsquo;s face
was still serious. &ldquo;I have to thank you for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in a day&rsquo;s adventure,&rdquo; said Johnny.
&ldquo;Mystery and adventure add to the joy of
life. Meanwhile, between us, we have a supply
of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and such a supply!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better take as much as we can
carry,&rdquo; Johnny sighed. He was thinking of
the weary trek back to camp. &ldquo;The part we
can&rsquo;t carry away on our further journeys we
can hide up in the rocks where foxes and
wolverines can&rsquo;t get at it. It&rsquo;s a good thing
to have a storehouse to which one may
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl agreed. Drawing her hunting
knife, she assisted him quite skilfully in skinning
the great beast and preparing the meat
for packing.</p>
<p>Once as she straightened up, he read in her
eyes a question. She was looking at the skin
which he thought of only as waste product.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of boats made of skin
drawn over a framework of wood,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Eskimos make them so. Large ones.
Thirty-five feet long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This skin is tough,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s large,
too. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate to trust it,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Ice might
cut a hole in it, then where&rsquo;d you be? Fresh
water ice isn&rsquo;t like salt water ice. Salt water
ice is crumbly. Fresh water ice is like flint. It
gets a cutting edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; Johnny said a few moments
later.</p>
<p>Wrapping a great piece of dark red meat in
a square of skin, he lifted it to her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carry it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>He felt like a brute, loading a girl so; yet
in future their lives might depend upon that
meat. Night was approaching. To return in
the dark was out of the question. And who
could say what the little foxes, the wolves
and wolverines would do to that dead moose
during the night?</p>
<p>So they trudged on with weary limbs, but
light hearts. As the darkness deepened there
came over Johnny a feeling that was hard to
analyze. It was a pleasing sensation, and had
to do with the girl. He was her guardian, her
protector. This day, with his bow and arrow
he had saved her life. There could be no question
about that. The tree she had climbed was
partially dead. In time, under the mad bull&rsquo;s
wild onslaught, it must have fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he shuddered at the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said quite suddenly, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t do a thing to that moose? Not a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except invade his territory in a bright red
sweater,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled. &ldquo;That was
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />A STRANGE MEETING</h2>
<p>&ldquo;That moose was very far north,&rdquo; said Gordon
Duncan, as they sat dreaming by the fire
after their first meal of moose steak. &ldquo;One seldom
finds them here. He was alone. Moose
and men are like that sometimes. They prefer
to live alone. Timmie was that way. He
longed for solitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes were half closed. He appeared
to be living in the past. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
mused, &ldquo;Timmie liked me. He promised to
wait for me back there behind the mountains.
But he liked to be alone. He&rsquo;s waiting there
still, behind the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s lips were parted for a question regarding
this long lost partner and the green
gold, but feeling the pressure of the girl&rsquo;s hand
on his arm, he left the question unasked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s afraid of getting him excited and
bringing on another attack,&rdquo; he thought to
himself.</p>
<p>That night as he lay rolled in his blankets
and the others slept farther back in the cave-like
shelter, he fell to wondering about the
strange pair. Why had they gone so far into
the wilderness? Why had they appeared to be
afraid of other human beings? Why, in the
end, had they lost all their fear of him and accepted
him as a traveling companion? How
much was to be expected from the future?
Was the old man&rsquo;s partly told tale of a lost
partner and the finding of green gold purely a
work of the imagination, a fairy story, or was
it all true? Would they find Timmie? Was he
waiting still? Would the green gold be there?
Was there much green gold? Was it valuable?
Was&mdash;</p>
<p>So, wondering on and on, he fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Next day, as they entered a narrow valley,
after toiling down a treacherous slope, they
came quite suddenly upon a well marked trail.
Trees had been blazed here and there, and
brush cleared away. True, there were no marks
of recent travel. Only here and there were
signs that told of someone passing weeks, perhaps
months before. This trail came from the
left, down a narrow ravine, then paralleled the
river on its way northward.</p>
<p>For a long time after discovering this trail,
Gordon Duncan stood quite motionless, apparently
buried in deep thought.</p>
<p>When at last he led the way onward, it was
to take up this trail. This he did in silence.
Not a word was uttered by any member of the
party.</p>
<p>To Johnny this silence was eloquent. What
had passed in Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s mind? Had
he read in this freshly discovered trail signs of
danger? Had he feared that his plans might
be brought to nought? Had he, in the end, decided
to risk it, to take the chance, to follow
the trail? To all these questions Johnny could
find no certain answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Noon came. They ate a cold lunch, then
pressed forward. This day the old man seemed
eager and tireless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to him than I thought,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself as he mopped his brow.
&ldquo;He may have a trick heart, but he certainly
can cover the miles, may live to see us all in
our graves yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon they were passing over a
level stretch of forest. To the right, the left,
before, behind, short stout fir trees stood like
sentries. The silence about them was oppressive.
Not a branch quivered, not a pine needle
stirred. When a white owl rose and went flap-flapping
away, his wings beat noisily.</p>
<p>In a moment he was gone, and only the
steady pat-pat of feet on the trail was to be
heard.</p>
<p>Then slowly, as in a dream, there came to
their overstrained ears a sound. Faint, indistinct,
it seemed at first but the approach of
wind through the treetops.</p>
<p>As they marched straight on this sound took
form, the sound of many small tinkling bells.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bells!&rdquo; the girl whispered, stopping short
in her tracks. &ldquo;Sleighbells. A dog team.&rdquo; She
clutched at her mackinaw as if to still the beating
of her heart.</p>
<p>Without a word, the old man turned and
marched away at right angles to the trail.
There was no concealing their tracks here. The
ground was level, the soft snow ten inches
deep. Soon, however, they came to a barren
ridge. Here they might walk upon rocks.
Soon they were lost from sight in a dark clump
of fir trees.</p>
<p>There, breathing silently, uttering not a
word, they waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why all this secrecy?&rdquo; Johnny asked himself.
&ldquo;They know; I do not.&rdquo; He felt annoyed
by it all. He turned to the girl, and was about
to speak when, putting one hand to her lips,
she pointed with the other.</p>
<p>A stout dog team had appeared down the
trail. Behind the sled, clad in the blue trousers
and red jacket of the Mounties, trotted a strapping
six-footer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; A look of relief spread over
Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Corporal Simons
of the Mounted. He has been in the wilderness
for months. We&rsquo;ll go to meet him. He may be
able to tell us of a way across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer business,&rdquo; Johnny thought to himself
as he followed Gordon Duncan back to the
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My old friend Gordon Duncan, as I live!&rdquo;
exclaimed the sturdy Corporal as he caught
sight of them. &ldquo;And Faye. But Man!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Why so far back into this great beyond?
Is it safe? You with your bows and
arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No place is far in this fair land of ours,&rdquo;
said Gordon Duncan. &ldquo;As for the bows and
arrows, you&rsquo;ll find fresh meat in our packs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than you&rsquo;ll find in mine,&rdquo; said
the Corporal, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been traveling light and
fast on the King&rsquo;s business. Sad business it is
to be, I fear. But say! The sun is about down.
Back on my trail a half mile or so is a cabin of
a sort. There&rsquo;s a rough fireplace and a Dutch
oven on the hearth. I thought of putting up
there for the night. Since you&rsquo;re here I&rsquo;ll turn
back. When a man&rsquo;s been on the trail among
Indians and Eskimos he welcomes a woman&rsquo;s
hand at the cooking. I&rsquo;ve a few supplies back
there.&rdquo; He gave Faye a warm smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who is this?&rdquo; There was a note of distrust
in his tone as he spoke. He had seen
Johnny for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only another nimrod we picked up by the
way,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll be getting on. Gee!&rdquo; the Corporal
spoke to his leader. The team whirled
about. Grasping Faye&rsquo;s pack, the driver
dropped it on the sled, then tossed her after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sort of thing for a girl to be doing,&rdquo; he
grumbled, &ldquo;packing her way through these
wilds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>An hour later Johnny found himself seated
at the corner of a rude stone fireplace. Before
the fire, enjoying their pipes, sat Gordon Duncan
and the Corporal. From the hearth came
delicious odors. From the Corporal&rsquo;s meager
supply of stores Faye had secured the proper
ingredients for a cake. It was now browning
to a turn in the Dutch oven.</p>
<p>As the boy sat there dreaming and wondering
about many things he caught the voice of
the Corporal. He was telling of some recent
happening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose happened to the
trader?&rdquo; he demanded of Gordon Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything might. Snow-blindness, blizzard,
wolves, an overflow on the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact is he didn&rsquo;t arrive.&rdquo; The Corporal&rsquo;s
voice rose. &ldquo;Those Caribou Eskimos have
come to depend upon him for ammunition. So
there they are. And there they&rsquo;ll be starved in
their tents. I can do nothing for them. Should
I try to return with supplies it would be too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as I have always said,&rdquo; Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s
tone was low and deep. &ldquo;The natives are
better off without us. They lived before we
came. How? By the bow, the spear, the snare
and the deadfall. But now we have taught
them to use firearms and if there is no ammunition
they must starve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred miles, did you say?&rdquo; He rose
and began pacing the cabin floor. &ldquo;It is incredible
that men should starve when we are so
near. There must be a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no food here,&rdquo; said the Corporal.
&ldquo;A dozen rounds of provision here in this
cabin. You chanced on a moose yesterday;
otherwise you would be hungry, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the caribou will be flooding in from the
Southwest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In another month, perhaps sooner. What
does it matter? I do not have ammunition.
Neither do you. You have only your bows and
arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Simons,&rdquo; the old man paused to
bang the table with his fist, &ldquo;with bows and
arrows we will save them. This young man, if
he will, and Faye will go with me. We will
show you what primitive weapons will do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself.&rdquo; The Corporal&rsquo;s tone
showed consternation. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t drag a
young woman into that barren land. I tell you
they are starving. Desperate. Who can say
what they might do? And after all,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;they are but Eskimos, mere savages. It is
sad, but the world will not miss them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no savages,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan,
resuming his place by the fire. &ldquo;In the
eyes of the All Seeing One, all men are the
same. In the past many a white man, many a
member of your force, has owed his life to
these simple people. Is it not so? Then we
owe them their lives in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident to Johnny that the Corporal
knew something of Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s state of
health, for at a look from Faye he said no
more.</p>
<p>A half hour later they were seated round a
rough board table graced by such a feast as
only a Scotch girl accustomed to the wilds
could have spread before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>The evening meal over, Gordon Duncan
dropped into a great rustic chair before the
fire. As Johnny watched he saw the old man
start as a change came over him. A battle of
conflicting emotions played across his expressive
face. Twice he half rose in his chair.
Many times he clenched his fists tight. Three
times he turned to speak to the Corporal. At
last, as he sank down deep in his chair, a look
of resignation came over his face. Peace now
reigned where a battle had raged. He was
soon sleeping in his chair.</p>
<p>Johnny could not read all the story that had
been recorded there. He knew too little regarding
the two possible courses of action that
lay before them and the purposes and emotions
that were back of them. He did know that an
idea had taken possession of Gordon Duncan.
He had had a partner in the past. They had
found some metal. He called it green gold.
Was it? Whatever it was, the whole soul of
the old man had been bent on finding that partner
and his treasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Now a man, an officer of the law, had told
him of a starving people. He had at once conceived
of a plan for helping them. Just what
those plans were Johnny did not clearly know.
Of one thing he felt certain. Having observed
the old man and understanding something of
his deep convictions, he felt sure that he
would feel compelled to go to the aid of those
who faced starvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faye will go,&rdquo; the old man had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I?&rdquo; Johnny asked himself this question
in all seriousness, but did not attempt to
answer it. He had seen much of life, had lived
in many climes; but to go into the great white
wilderness to a desperate tribe of starving half
savages in the company of an old man and a
girl, armed only with bows and arrows&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good could we possibly do?&rdquo; he
asked himself.</p>
<p>The simple household duties of the cabin
done, Faye joined them beside the fire.</p>
<p>She had been sitting there but a short time
when a great shaggy dog, one of the Corporal&rsquo;s
team, rose from the floor and approached
her. After kissing her hand he laid his shaggy
head in her lap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He knows you,&rdquo; said the Corporal in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He used to belong to a
next door neighbor. You must have bought
him from that man. We are great friends,&rdquo;
she said, addressing the dog. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we,
Tico?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of the name Tico, the dog gave
forth a low woof, then stood staring intently
into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; the Corporal said quite
suddenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him to you. Then if you
go&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;wherever you go, he&rsquo;ll be
company, protector and guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not much account in the team, anyway,&rdquo;
he added half apologetically. &ldquo;Too old
when I took him. Dogs need to be trained
young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;why, thank you! That would be
grand, wouldn&rsquo;t it, Tico?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog woofed again; then, as if he had
understood everything that had been said,
dropped to a place at her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So now we are four,&rdquo; Johnny thought to
himself as, rising from his place he took up the
axe and went out into the night to gather a
fresh supply of fuel.</p>
<p>When he returned Gordon Duncan was still
fast asleep. Sitting quite close to the girl, the
Corporal was talking in low tones. As Johnny
took his place he caught the word cabin. A little
later a boat was spoken of, then timber and
a broad tundra.</p>
<p>Taking the stub of a pencil and a sheet of
paper from his pocket, the officer drew what
was likely to be a rough map.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Johnny understood in a general way what
was happening. The Corporal realized that he
had, without intending to do so, stirred up in
Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s breast a fire not easily
quenched. He had so worked upon his almost
exaggerated sense of duty that he would be
driven to attempt the seemingly impossible.
Without adding fuel to the flames by giving
the old man a detailed description of the route
to be taken, he was imparting that knowledge
to Faye Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well thought out and mighty decent of
him,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s mental comment. With
that thought uppermost in his mind, he went
about the business of preparing for a night&rsquo;s
repose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />A LOOK BEYOND</h2>
<p>The Corporal was up and away before dawn.
Having assisted him with his dogs, Johnny
returned to the cabin.</p>
<p>In his sleeping bag on a rude bunk in the
corner Gordon Duncan still slept. Before the
fire sat Faye Duncan. She had thrown fresh
fuel on the fire. The flames were leaping up
the chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know,&rdquo; she said as he took a
seat beside her, &ldquo;that Grandfather will accept
this new mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had supposed he would.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to. The finding of his long
lost partner and the green gold has obsessed
him for years. It is natural that he should
want to go on. But he is deeply religious and,
what is better, has a great heart. There are
those who suffer. It is possible for him to give
them aid. Duty calls. He must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But only three of us!&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;How
can we help? We may starve, ourselves. In
their ignorance, superstition and great need
they may attack us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have eight bows between us,&rdquo; the girl
said quietly. &ldquo;A bow weighs very little. We
always carried a good supply. Never as many
as now. Providence must have directed us. We
have many arrow points. Thongs, feathers,
material for shafts may be had in the wilderness.
A bow is a precious thing. Its wood
must be of the best and seasoned many months.
We are fortunate in having so many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, we can use but three bows at a
time,&rdquo; Johnny said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather believes that there are old
men among the Eskimos who have been archers
and have not forgot. If he can arm these
with our extra bows, if we can somehow ambush
the caribou when they come, we may
save those starving ones yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Johnny looked at her in silence. His mind
was in a whirl. Here was an old man and a girl
who but a few days before, as if guilty of some
crime, were hiding in the brush. Yet, at this
moment they were planning a long and dangerous
journey far out on the tundra in the
hope of saving the lives of a few half savage
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer folks,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here we are,&rdquo; the girl went on after a
moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;In an hour we shall be on
our way. Before us is the wilderness, after that
a river, the land of little sticks and the silent,
white tundra. We carry only our precious
bows and arrows. It seems a foolhardy and
futile undertaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think!&rdquo; Her voice became vibrant with
emotion. &ldquo;Unless someone comes to them,
men, women and cute little brown babies will
starve&mdash;starve!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>She cupped her chin in her hands to stare
at the fire. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fear for myself,&rdquo; her tone
was deep and solemn. &ldquo;I only fear for him.
He is old, though he has the heart of a boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear him stirring,&rdquo; she said softly,
springing to her feet. &ldquo;I must prepare breakfast.
He is always impatient of delays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I promised to go
with you. I&rsquo;ll not turn back now. Count me
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not speak. She put out a hand.
It was a good, strong, capable hand. Johnny
gripped it heartily. And there in the dawn
was sealed a compact that was to live through
many a long day of wild adventure.</p>
<p>Noon of that day found the little party looking
down upon a scene of surpassing beauty.
This was one of those days of crystal-like
clearness. From the promontory on which
they now stood, the crest of the range, their
vision stretched mile on mile, seeming never
to end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Spreading out a roughly drawn map, Gordon
Duncan traced for Johnny the course they
were to take. He had gotten it from Faye,
who in turn had it from the Corporal. Here,
down the ridge, they followed the blazed trail.
There, where a huge black tamarack tree stood,
they bent to the right. A short way farther,
and they came to the boiling and tumultuous
stream again. Following this as best they
might over rock pile and ledge, through dense
forest and thicket, they would come at last
to a broad, tree covered valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the entrance to that valley,&rdquo; the old
man ended, carefully refolding his map, &ldquo;unless
we have gone wrong, we will find a rude
shelter and close beside it an Indian dugout
canoe. The canoe was left there six months
ago, but the Corporal thinks it is still in
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;For if it is
not, our journey ends there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with its ending the fate of many
human lives is sealed,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan
solemnly. &ldquo;It is strange that so much should
depend upon so little. But we must do our
part. We are enlisted in a great cause, the
welfare of a vanishing race.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>As Johnny stood there looking away to the
north, where even now it seemed he caught
the gleam of a snow blanket, strange thoughts
passed through his mind.</p>
<p>In a spirit almost of bravado, he had one
morning slung his quiver of arrows over his
back, bound his pack together, seized his bow
and walked away into the wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to be away a month,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;I would remain in the wilderness a
month and receive no support save that which
came from my bow and arrow. Well,&rdquo; his
face twisted into a doubtful smile, &ldquo;it will be
a month right enough, probably two, perhaps
three. And the bow and arrow must support
us, not one but three. There is no other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two months! Perhaps three!&rdquo; He said the
words out loud. &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;ll think me dead!
I must go back. It isn&rsquo;t treating them right.
I must go back!&rdquo; He was thinking of his own
people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; As he closed his eyes to think
he saw a group of little brown people, many
groups, seated round the fast vanishing lights
of crude tallow lamps. He saw the wan faces
of mothers, the eyes of children that gleamed
the bright gleam of death by starvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must always think of the highest good
of the greatest number.&rdquo; He quoted the words
of a great teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we ready?&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ready,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Lead on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more they marched on.</p>
<p>Two days later the girl and boy stood upon
the crest of a high hill. Gordon Duncan was
back some distance on the trail. Johnny would
have gone back for his pack. But the aged
Scotchman was still proud of his strength.
This was the last climb for the day. Their
camping place for the night was at the foot
of the hill just before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Here there were no trees, only rocks. Their
view was not obstructed. Far away behind
hills that had turned to pure gold and mountains
that appeared to smoke with the snow
driven far and wide by the wind of their summits,
the sun was setting. Far below was the
river, a golden ribbon winding across a field
of white satin.</p>
<p>So they stood there, the boy and the girl.
Life, beautiful, glorious life, surged through
their beings. It was inconceivable that anyone
in all the world could be starving at this
moment.</p>
<p>Spring was in the making. They did not see
it. The willows by the river were not budding.
The snow of the trail was hard as the rocks
on which they now stood; yet spring was coming.
They could feel it in their blood.</p>
<p>Youth, spring, life. The night before they
had stood for a moment beneath the starry
heavens wondering what life could exist in
those great distances beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it may be,&rdquo; Johnny told himself,
&ldquo;it could not be more wonderful than life here
and now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Life! The great cities with their noise and
dirt, with their artificiality, their fraud and
sham, were far away. The girl that stood at
his side was real. From toes to fingertips, she
was genuine. Her mackinaw was faded, her
knickers frayed in spots, but the color in her
cheeks, the smile on her lips, the glint of pure
joy in her eye, were real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the word aloud. She heard and understood.</p>
<p>It was well for them that they enjoyed this
perfect moment together, for the days that
were to come were such as require strong and
beautiful memories to lessen their pain.</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan came toiling up the hill.
Seeing the halo of sunset glory that had been
cast about them, he said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is truly wonderful. Who could believe
that less than two hundred miles from this
spot men, women and little children may be
starving? There are men who will tell you
that nature is God. A cruel God indeed who
could furnish us such beauty and offer to them
only death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>The sun sank from sight. Darkness and a
sudden chill overtook them. Turning, they
marched down the hill in silence.</p>
<p>Several nights later, with only a shelter of
poles covered by boughs, Johnny slept again
in his blankets before the fire. His was the
sleep of one whose burdens are heavy, whose
trails have been long, but whose heart is light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The canoe is fit,&rdquo; was the last word of
Gordon Duncan before they went to rest. &ldquo;Fit
as a fiddle. To-morrow the river takes us on
the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember,&rdquo; said his granddaughter,
&ldquo;that there are rapids in the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are never rapids in any life till we
reach them,&rdquo; said the rugged old Scot. &ldquo;And
when we do reach them we can but do our part.
God will see that all is for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />A HAVEN OF REFUGE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is going to storm.&rdquo; The old Scot dropped
his paddle to the bottom of the dugout long
enough to turn up the collar of his jacket, then
he took up the mechanical swing of his brawny
arms that had done so much in the days that
had just passed to speed the three adventurers
on into the Northland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be a bad one!&rdquo; Johnny threw a
fleeting glance at the girl before him. Like her
grandfather, she performed wonders. She had
kept up the steady, monotonous swing of
paddle until Johnny thought she must be working
in her sleep. The muscles of her arms had
grown hard as a man&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They had found the Corporal&rsquo;s cottonwood
dugout a good one. For three days it had carried
them straight on into the great unknown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After all, she&rsquo;s only a girl,&rdquo; he told himself,
thinking once more of the girl. &ldquo;This
storm will be a bad one. Wish we&rsquo;d come to
shelter. The map shows a cabin or something
down here somewhere. Be easy enough to pass
it in the storm. Map don&rsquo;t show which bank.
Wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the advance guard of the storm
struck. A rattling drive of cutting snow, a
sudden gust that set their canoe on side, and
it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there will be other blasts and worse
ones,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>In this he was right. A half hour had not
passed before they were shooting along
through a veritable wall of driving white. One
of those sudden and terrible storms that haunt
the Arctic had come driving down from the
North.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have to go ashore and try to get up something
of a camp,&rdquo; said the old Scot, as with
the greatest difficulty he unbent his benumbed
fingers. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stand this. Cold and damp will
get us. Wind off that ice water is terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more Johnny looked at the girl. Gripping
her paddle, she still swung her arms in
rhythmic motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half froze,&rdquo; he thought, with a tightening
of the throat. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing and enduring all
for the good of people she has not seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then there was a stir in the prow of the
canoe. Tico, the dog given to Faye by the
Corporal, had crept from his snug corner to
lift his nose to the air, point toward the farther
shore, and let out an unhappy wail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something over there.&rdquo; The girl spoke now
for the first time in a half hour. &ldquo;Maybe game.
That&rsquo;s something. Our food supply is very
low. Better go over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither the old Scot nor Johnny questioned
her judgment. Turning the canoe half about,
they struck for that distant shore.</p>
<p>It was a perilous journey. The moment they
left the sheltering bank, waves began crashing
over the gunwale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The boat was half filled when the girl, dropping
her paddle, began to bale. The men toiled
unremittingly at the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s with us. Be there soon,&rdquo; Johnny
said cheeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-roo!&rdquo; answered the dog. Standing high
in the prow, he appeared to direct their course.</p>
<p>They were still half a boat length from shore
when with a mighty leap the dog, clearing the
boat, landed on the ice that edged the water
and at once shot away into the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tico! Tico!&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;Come back!
Come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wind and water drowned her cries. The
dog did not return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we can do is to follow him,&rdquo; said
Johnny as he made the boat fast to a bough
that hung far out over ice and water, then
tested the ice with an axe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me have those,&rdquo; he said as Gordon
Duncan was about to throw his bundle of bows
and arrows ashore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you better carry them,&rdquo; said Gordon
Duncan. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be too careful of your artillery
in such a land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a dangerous slide or two they were
on land.</p>
<p>Following the dog&rsquo;s steps in the snow,
Johnny led the way into the tangled brush. To
his great joy he found indications of a rough
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May have been made by moose or caribou,
for all that,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; the girl exclaimed suddenly,
stopping short.</p>
<p>From behind them had come a cracking
sound.</p>
<p>Dropping the bundle of arrows he carried,
Johnny sprang back over the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; There was a touch of despair
in his voice as he called to his companions.
&ldquo;The boat&rsquo;s gone! The branch tore away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never in his life had he felt more miserable.
No food, no blankets, no shelter in a strange
land, hundreds of miles from known human
habitation, with a blizzard tearing at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all my fault,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was I
who tied the boat. I should have tested the
moorings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan. There was force
and dignity in his tone. &ldquo;It is not entirely your
fault. We were there to offer counsel. And
this is not the end. It is but the beginning.
We have bows and arrows. There is game here
as elsewhere. There is always a way to prepare
a shelter and make a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first we must find Tico,&rdquo; said the girl,
who had just come up to them. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
imagine what madness has seized him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogs,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan, &ldquo;are sometimes
wiser than humans. There may be
something in his actions that is worth investigating.
Let us be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this he was more right than he knew.</p>
<p>They had not gone a hundred yards when
the trail widened. Another hundred yards, and
a dark bulk loomed through the whirling snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cabin or a boulder,&rdquo; said Johnny a little
breathlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Either will prove a boon,&rdquo; said the old Scot.
&ldquo;A shelter in the time of storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cabin! A cabin!&rdquo; the girl cried joyously
as the dog came bounding back to meet her.</p>
<p>And such a cabin as it proved to be! Built
of massive logs, with a door that required the
strength of two to swing it wide, what a
haven! It was equipped with rude bunks, a
hand hewn table and chairs and a massive
stone fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan, a note of deep,
silent joy creeping into his voice, &ldquo;is the very
place we were to leave the canoe and strike
away across the tundra. Truly we have been
guided by a great good God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, and Tico,&rdquo; whispered the girl as she
sank down upon a chair. There was no suggestion
of irreverence in her tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, and the dog,&rdquo; said the old Scot. &ldquo;I
doubt not that many times the great Creator
finds a dog&rsquo;s course more easy to direct than
that of a human.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>A hasty survey of the cabin revealed many
delightful surprises. Built, no doubt, by some
trader and trapper of bygone days, it had been
fashioned to shut out the rigor of winter and
the tearing rush of wild northern gales. It had
been equipped with massive iron cooking
utensiles which were still serviceable. It had,
beyond doubt, been used by the Mounted
Police as a temporary station, for, hidden away
among the rafters were blankets, a coffee pot,
a small quantity of flour and baking powder,
a can of coffee, a sack of beans and a square of
bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man! Did I not tell you?&rdquo; exclaimed the
joyous Scot. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas God&rsquo;s hand that led us.
&rsquo;Tis a royal feast we&rsquo;ll have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No better fritters were ever made than
those moulded by the hands of the bonny lassie
here. Bacon, fritters, coffee beside a fire that
laughs up a generous chimney. Who could
ask for more?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Johnny joined with the old Scot in his rejoicing.
He had not, however, forgotten that their
boat was irretrievably lost and that it was
many, many weary miles back, even to the
cabin where they had enjoyed their last real
night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Being young and strong, possessed of a
healthy body and a vigorous mind, he did not
trouble about the future for long, but springing
out into the storm, began dragging in dry
brush and logs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now the storm may laugh and the wind
crack her cheeks!&rdquo; exclaimed the Scot as he
attacked the branches with an axe he had
found in the corner.</p>
<p>Bacon, fritters and coffee might seem a
meager feast. But to those who had lived for
days on caribou steak, rabbits, partridge and
squirrel, it was indeed a rich repast. Even
Tico enjoyed it beyond his power to express.</p>
<p>When at last the feast was over and the
heavy pots and pans hung in their places
Johnny piled three great spruce logs in the
center of the fireplace, thrust dry branches and
wind wrecked splintered fragments in the
niches between, then with his friends sat down
to watch with dreamy eyes the leaping, laughing,
roaring flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>The old Scot was soon nodding in his chair.
Lower and lower his head sank upon his
breast until only the tangled gray of hair and
beard were visible.</p>
<p>Softly, on tiptoe, the girl went to bend over
his chair. As she tiptoed back to her place
beside the boy, she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>For a long time, save for the roar of the
wind outside answered by the crackle of the
fire within, there was silence. But who can
say what communion may be had between
hearts loyal and true in moments of silence?</p>
<p>When the girl spoke her tone was deep and
low. &ldquo;I am afraid for him. His heart,&rdquo; she
said, glancing toward the sleeping patriarch,
&ldquo;Some day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish, but once more sat starring
at the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;is to be his one
great adventure. He has the heart of youth,
of a knight, a Crusader. We have always lived
quietly on our farm, except for these trips into
the forest. Always since he was a boy, he has
told me, he has longed for an opportunity to
render a great service. He believes this is his
great opportunity, his crowded hour, this and
his final search for old Timmie and his green
gold. What a triumph it will be if he accomplishes
all!&rdquo; Again she stared at the fire.</p>
<p>Johnny nodded. He understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will do all we can to help him realize
his highest hope,&rdquo; he said huskily.</p>
<p>A moment later, as the wind shook the
cabin, the girl&rsquo;s mood changed. She found herself
longing for the home of many simple comforts
she had left to follow her grandfather on
this strange and uncertain quest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have never seen our home,&rdquo; she said
dreamily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a palace, but it&rsquo;s home.
Just a cottage with vines climbing up the front
and with fine old fashioned roses, yellow, pink
and red, on either side. There&rsquo;s a cozy little
parlor with a reed organ in one corner. Grandfather
loves to sing to it on a Sunday afternoon,
those old, old fashioned tunes that are
so quaint and so&mdash;so sort of wonderful. You
should hear him boom them out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My room,&rdquo; she went on as if speaking to
herself, &ldquo;looks out upon a field of red clover
at the side, and at the back is a clump of forest.
The squirrels are so tame that they come to
perch on my window sill and beg for sweets
and nuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she ceased speaking Johnny looked at her
and realized as never before that she was,
despite her rugged face and splendid untiring
muscles, only a girl very far from the nest that
she called home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly as if waking
from a dream, &ldquo;we must not turn back! We
must go on! Go on for him!&rdquo; She nodded
toward the sleeping grandfather. &ldquo;And for the
little brown people who, but for us, may
starve.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Three days the storm raged on. Restful days
these were, but not idle ones. Some of their
arrows had gone downstream with their ill-fated
cottonwood boat. Fortunately they
found within the cabin two steel sled runners
and a home-made feather duster. The dusters
were made of wild goose feathers. No better
for arrows can be found. With the aid of fire
and such tools as were at hand, they succeeded
in cutting the sled runners into bits and fashioning
them into arrow heads. Dry fir furnished
them shafts for the arrows. Long
hours, working side by side over the table,
the boy and girl, directed by the old man,
worked at the task of making arrows. Cutting,
scraping, shaping, pounding, forging, binding,
with grimy hands but gleaming eyes they
worked on and on until when the storm broke
and the sun came out they found themselves
better armed than ever before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So we may say the storm was a blessing in
disguise,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan. &ldquo;To-morrow
we must be on our way,&rdquo; he said as he gazed
upon the fading tints of their first red sunset
in the wilderness. &ldquo;We must hurry. The caribou
may come and pass to their northern
feeding grounds before us. Then indeed our
little brown friends will starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we with them,&rdquo; Johnny wanted to add,
but did not.</p>
<p>That night, by the light of the fire, Johnny
spent a full hour studying three maps he had
spread out on the table. More than once a
sudden exclamation escaped his lips. At last
he rose and began pacing the floor. The old
Scot was asleep in his chair. Faye Duncan had
watched Johnny with keen interest. Now as
she caught the light of a quizzical smile playing
across his face, she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why look!&rdquo; he replied, leading her to the
table. &ldquo;See, here are three maps, the one done
on white leather by your grandfather so many
years ago, the roughly drawn one by the Corporal
to guide us on this trip, and an old general
map of the country which I found here in
the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he said, straightening up,
&ldquo;but when you trace the two routes out, the one
your grandfather proposed to follow in his
search for that more or less mythical partner
of his&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; Her finger touched his
lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very real to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, we are now across the river,
and if we follow the route the Corporal has
marked out for us we will be going almost
directly toward the spot your grandfather has
marked for Timmie&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, reading the surprise and joy
in her eye, &ldquo;the longest way round is the shortest
way home, after all! See!&rdquo; He pointed to
a spot on the map. &ldquo;See. There is the camp
of the Eskimo. And here, just a short way
across the tundra, then over these low mountains,
is Timmie&rsquo;s cabin and the&mdash;the green
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So in choosing to be of service to the
natives, Grandfather was really serving himself,&rdquo;
the girl said as they returned to their
places before the fire. &ldquo;How often life is like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green gold.&rdquo; She repeated the words
thoughtfully after a time. &ldquo;Do you suppose
there is any such thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course there is,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;They
use it for making jewelry, rings, watch-cases
and the like. But where it comes from I haven&rsquo;t
the least notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is it very valuable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, it must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if there was a lot of it, a mine or something,
and Grandfather has a share, we would
be&mdash;might be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Her eyes shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said after some time, &ldquo;we
are quite poor and we&mdash;Grandfather might
need money badly to&mdash;to defend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny waited long for the rest of that
sentence. It never came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;to-morrow it&rsquo;s the
long, long trail once more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />A MOVING ISLAND</h2>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson thought he heard the
beating of Faye Duncan&rsquo;s heart as she whispered
these words in his ears.</p>
<p>They lay close together on the snow against
a little rise of land. From this place they could
see nothing before them. A faint crackling
sound was all that told them that a moving
island of brown, a great herd of caribou, was
moving up the narrow valley and would,
within the space of a quarter of an hour, be
abreast of them and within easy bow shot.</p>
<p>Their position was not without its element
of danger. Johnny&rsquo;s heart missed a beat at
the thought. The caribou, when they had
last seen them, were moving with the steady
precision of an army. There were thousands of
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if a mother wolf and her pack appears
to the right of them, then what?&rdquo; Johnny
asked himself. He knew how broad and sharp
were the hoofs of the caribou. It was these
very hoofs that made the steady click and
crash as of a thousand batons beating on
wooden rails. Visions of that vast herd
stampeding and rushing down upon them like
a relentless sea passed before his mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t have come,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was our only chance,&rdquo; the girl whispered
back. &ldquo;Our chance for the Eskimos and for
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this she appeared to speak the truth.
Johnny lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>Four days had passed since on that bright
morning they had left the abandoned trapper&rsquo;s
cabin.</p>
<p>Borrowing blankets and a little food from
the cabin, they had started out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>The going had been heavy from the start.
The forest had disappeared almost at once.
Guided by the dog Tico, they had found themselves
following a northerly course over a flat
and trackless tundra.</p>
<p>Day after day they had tramped on. For a
time there had been plenty of game, ptarmigan
on little ridges, rabbits in the bottoms.</p>
<p>As they advanced these had disappeared.
And now for an entire twenty-four hours they
had eaten nothing.</p>
<p>An hour before they had mounted a narrow
rise of land to find themselves gazing upon a
curious sight. A broad brown island, long and
narrow and weaving in and out, had been moving
toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caribou! We are too late!&rdquo; The excitement
had been too much for Gordon Duncan.
Seized by a sudden heart attack, he had fallen
upon the snow. All he could do as his stout
hearted companions assured him that all was
not lost was to lie flat upon his blankets and
struggle painfully for breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will take our bows and arrows and hide
in one of the little runs,&rdquo; Johnny had explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When that throng is passing we surely can
pick off a number of caribou. The Eskimo village
must not now be far away. We will build
a cairn for the meat and can return for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny wondered now as the sound of thousands
of crackling hoofs grew louder, whether
his words would prove true. Was the Eskimo
village near? Would they succeed in shooting
enough caribou to be of real service? Could
the meat be kept away from the wolves?</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least we shall eat again,&rdquo; he whispered
stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl whispered back, as with nervous
fingers she gripped her bow. She had been
loath to leave her grandfather back there
alone on the tundra. He had insisted. So here
they were. And here, coming closer, ever
closer, was the moving island of brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There is one!&rdquo; she whispered as a
pair of massive antlers appeared above the
ridge&rsquo;s crest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>A splendid young buck, having climbed the
ridge, had risen above the snow. There for
a moment he stood, head high, sniffing the
air. That moment was his last, for with the
speed and precision that would have done
credit to a daughter of William Tell, the stout
hearted Scotch girl sent an arrow unerring to
its mark.</p>
<p>The next instant Johnny and Faye were on
their feet making the most of their opportunity.</p>
<p>That the opportunity was poor enough they
were soon to learn. Like a mighty stream that
breaks its bonds to race over land, this mass
of brown flowed away before their very eyes.</p>
<p>A dozen arrows shot, half of them lost forever,
and only two caribou to show for it all.
This was their score.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the girl, dropping to the snow,
weak with excitement, &ldquo;as you said before, we
will eat to-night. As for the Eskimos, there
must be some other way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;there must be some&mdash;some
other way.&rdquo; He seemed suddenly to have
grown very weak and old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-l-l, it&rsquo;s not so bad.&rdquo; It was the voice of
an old man grown suddenly strong that
sounded in Johnny&rsquo;s ear. A moment more and
Gordon Duncan, with Tico hitched to an
improvised sled, stood beside them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for yonder little brown people, God will
provide in his own good way,&rdquo; he said as he
led them down the ridge.</p>
<p>That night between the sheltering banks of
a narrow gorge, they built a shanty of willow
bushes. The beds they slept on after a royal
feast of roasted caribou steak were made of
rustling willow leaves.</p>
<p>Next morning, after cutting a draw line
from a caribou skin, Johnny piled all the
remaining meat on the sled, and putting his
own shoulder to the harness, bade Tico lead on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>It was hard, grinding toil, but he hung to the
task until, after climbing a slight elevation,
Faye let out a cry of joy. Before them in the
valley, pitched in an irregular circle, were a
half dozen skin tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Caribou Eskimos.&rdquo; The words that
came from the old Scot&rsquo;s lips spoke volumes of
joy. What did it matter now that the way
had been long and hard, that they had faced
death by water, storm and cold? What did
he care that they had but two caribou on their
sled and that the great caribou band had
passed northward? They had found the people
they had come to serve. God would find
a way to perfect their labors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the people?&rdquo; Faye asked.</p>
<p>Where indeed? Not a living creature was
stirring about the tents. Not a film of smoke
curled up from the tent poles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a village of the dead,&rdquo; Johnny said
in an awed whisper. In this he was more
nearly right than he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone hunting,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan. His
words carried no conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s hurry,&rdquo; said the girl,
springing forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Once more Johnny put his shoulder to the
sled. Gordon Duncan and Faye also seized the
strap and together they went racing away
down the slight incline that led to the village.</p>
<p>No sadder sight had this trio known than
that which met their eyes as they peered within
the first low, circular tent. Sprawled upon deer
skins, sitting bent over as in a stupor, or lying
prone like dead men, nine Eskimos greeted
their entrance with not so much as a mumbled
word or a stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s mental comment as
he felt the girl&rsquo;s impulsive grip on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not dead; only
in a stupor from lack of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; came back in a hollow tone as if
from a tomb. One of the squatting figures
attempted to rise. His knees doubled up under
him and he rolled upon the deerskins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food!&rdquo; Johnny said. &ldquo;We have caribou
meat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>It seemed certain that but one of the Eskimos
understood, the man who had made a
futile attempt to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no caribou meat here,&rdquo; he mumbled
hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have caribou meat for you, a sled load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rolling himself into a half sitting position,
the English speaking Eskimo said a few words
in his own tongue.</p>
<p>The effect was electrical. It was as if a
strong current had been sent through the
motionless bodies that lay about on the deerskins.
With one accord they began creeping,
crawling, tumbling toward the entrance to the
tent.</p>
<p>For this Johnny was prepared. Quickly unlashing
the sled, he produced a quantity of
roasted meat. This he cut into little squares
and handed to the Eskimos.</p>
<p>They ate like famished wolves. Yet, in this
extremity they did not forget their fellow villagers.
When each had eaten a little they
waved their hands toward the other tents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Fortunately the remaining tents were not
so crowded as this one. Sad to relate, two of
the occupants were beyond human aid.</p>
<p>When night fell upon the white sweep of
the tundra and the three rescue workers, worn
out by the day&rsquo;s excitement and labor, sought
the little tent and the pile of deerskins that
had been surrendered to their use, the dead
had been carried to their last resting place and
the living had been made as comfortable as
possible. Then it was that they took stock of
supplies and cast about for signs of the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks rather hopeless,&rdquo; Johnny said as he
sank down upon the deerskins. &ldquo;Food we have
can&rsquo;t do more than revive them. What next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in answer to his question, the English
speaking Eskimo came creeping into the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you cartridges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No cartridges,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;White man,&rdquo; he mumbled,
&ldquo;no got cartridges. No cartridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan, with eyes
alight. &ldquo;Before the white man came, how did
your people live?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Caribou meat. Plenty caribou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they kill them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bow and arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your bows and arrows now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shrugged, then went through the
motion of breaking something over his knees.
&ldquo;No good, bows and arrows. Rifles better,
think mine. Think that every Eskimo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could you do now if you had cartridges
for your rifle?&rdquo; Duncan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get caribou.&rdquo; The Eskimo&rsquo;s eyes were
alight with hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they have gone far north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some caribou. Not all caribou. Come more
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Gordon Duncan was on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Come more. Not tell lie, mine. Come
more. Mebby to-morrow. Mebby next day.
Can&rsquo;t tell. Come, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, see here!&rdquo; Gordon Duncan unbound
his bundle of bows. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all shoot true
and strong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just give me the right
man to draw them. There are old men among
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; said the Eskimo. &ldquo;Kit-me-suk,
Teragloona, Omnakok.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for the wisest of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was brought in. There followed
two hours of talking, relating, explaining,
planning. Through the young interpreter the
aged Eskimo related adventures of long ago,
tales of mighty caribou hunts he had known
before the white man came with his firearms.</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan in his turn outlined a hunt
for the caribou that were yet to come, which,
if his dream came true, was to be the mightiest
hunt of all time.</p>
<p>In the end, with their splendid imaginations
on fire, the old man and the young interpreter
returned to their people to inspire them in turn
with high hope and with dreams of wild
adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>A long time that night Johnny lay awake
among his deerskins. There were thoughts
enough to keep him awake. A whole tribe of
little brown people now were dependent upon
the skill and prowess of Gordon Duncan in
organizing a hunt. Most of the actual execution
must fall upon Johnny&rsquo;s young shoulders,
for Gordon Duncan was old. Little wonder,
then, that he did not sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are trusting all to this one grand endeavor,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Little of our caribou
meat is left. If the next drove does not
pass this way, if we fail in the hunt, then we
too must starve.&rdquo; He thought of Faye Duncan
and her aged grandsire and wished they had
not chosen to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must succeed,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;We
must! MUST!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan they were to follow, the ancient
plan used by the Eskimos, was not a complicated
one. Yet it required skill and prowess.
As the drove came in from the rolling hills to
the south they were to be directed by native
drivers on a course that would take them
across a narrow, shallow stretch of water that
lay between two lakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>As they neared this narrow stretch of water
the caribou would find themselves cut off by
native drivers and imaginary natives built of
stone piles and deerskins. They would then
take to a deeper, broader stretch of water
which would force them to swim. At the far
bank, in ambush the hunters would wait with
drawn bows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we succeed,&rdquo; Johnny thought. &ldquo;If we
do.&rdquo; He had visions of a long journey over
hard packed snow with meat aplenty on Tico&rsquo;s
sled, and after that a long, long rest in a cabin
somewhere on at the back of beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo; He thought of Timmie,
the old man&rsquo;s one time pal, and his green gold.
The season would not be over until that
mystery was solved or abandoned forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we succeed?&rdquo; he thought again. He
remembered the fear that Gordon Duncan and
Faye had shown on meeting white men. Would
they return to that cottage that Faye called
home? Who could tell?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />TREACHERY IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I hear them! They are coming! Oh, Grandfather!
Johnny Thompson! They are coming!
The caribou are coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As on that other occasion, the girl&rsquo;s words
were uttered in a low whisper, yet so tense
were her feelings that her whispered words
left in Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s mind the impression
of a sharp, shrill cry.</p>
<p>At once the boy&rsquo;s mind was in a whirl. Had
she heard them? Were they truly coming?
Faye Duncan&rsquo;s ears were keen as a fox&rsquo;s. Her
imagination also was keen. Had imagination
deceived her? He had heard nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are coming, they may not pass this
way.&rdquo; This he whispered to the girl. &ldquo;We
must not hope too much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we must not,&rdquo; she answered quietly.
&ldquo;But I did hear it distinctly, the crack-crack of
their hoofs! The wind brought in the sound.
It&rsquo;s died down now. I can hear it no longer.
But,&rdquo; she whispered tensely, &ldquo;they must
come! They must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Johnny agreed. Three days had
passed since they arrived at the Eskimo camp.
In that time, enheartened and strengthened by
the white man&rsquo;s caribou meat, the Eskimo had
killed with bow and arrow five rabbits, three
foxes and eight ptarmigan. But what were
these among so many? The caribou meat was
gone. Rabbit, fox, ptarmigan, all were gone,
and starvation stared both Eskimos and whites
in the face.</p>
<p>As the caribou had delayed their coming,
there had been grumbling among the Eskimos.
An aged witch doctor had said that the presence
of the white men in the village had
offended the spirits of all dead caribou and
that they had told the living caribou to go
north over some other route.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shall all starve,&rdquo; the Eskimo had said,
shaking with fear of the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only they were not such children!&rdquo; the
old Scot had said to Johnny. &ldquo;If they had more
courage and determination they might live a
long time on small game. But, having become
accustomed to living upon game taken by the
rifle, they see only death ahead when no
ammunition is to be had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of all this waiting and doubting
an Eskimo had come running in from a long
hunt in the distant hills. He had seen a band
of caribou. They were coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; Johnny had asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desra! Desra!&rdquo; (plenty! plenty!) The man
had spread his arms wide.</p>
<p>At once all was noise and confusion. It had
been with the greatest difficulty that Gordon
Duncan had silenced their noisy chatter and
had organized the hunt that was to mean life
or death to the whole band.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Women and children were sent away into
the hills. One band of men was stationed at
the right of the lakes. These were to rush in
at the proper time and urge the caribou on.
A second group was concealed in a clump of
willows close to the narrow neck of water
which the caribou would expect to cross.
These, at the proper time, would turn them to
another course and force them to a swimming
passage.</p>
<p>Carefully concealed in a second clump of
willows on the opposite bank were the true
hunters. Seven Eskimos, the older men who
retained some skill with bow and arrow, were
here. So too were the three whites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be easy,&rdquo; Johnny told
himself, &ldquo;especially for the girl. We will be
wading deep in stinging water. And these
natives have been able to provide us with no
waterproof skin garments for our protection.
The sea Eskimos could have given us hip boots
of sealskin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>With this thought he was led to wonder
that a people who had dwelt for so long a time
upon the border of the sea should have come
inland to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so strange, after all,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;It is so in other lands. In Borneo there
are the sea dwellers and the mountain tribes.
In Siberia are the Reindeer Chukchees and the
Sea Hunting Chukchees. It seems&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were broken off by a sharp
whispered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There! Don&rsquo;t you hear them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny listened and, as he held his breath,
above the dry rustle of dead willow leaves,
he did catch the unmistakable crash and rattle
of an oncoming army of caribou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant that they may not turn back!&rdquo;
said Gordon Duncan as he whispered a fervent
prayer to his God that He might prove that
day that He, the great Father, and not the
spirit of some dead animal, directed the flight
of wild birds and the courses of the herds of
all wild creatures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Johnny thought again of the chilling water
where a film of thin ice was forming, and
shuddered.</p>
<p>Knowing that their wait might be long, he
had spent much time in preparing a comfortable
place of concealment. He had cut armfuls
of slender willow shoots to which the dry
leaves still clung. From these he had made
a soft cushioned resting place. About this he
had built a tight wall of leafed branches. This
wall kept out the wind. Here, huddled close
together, they were comfortable indeed. Compared
to this, the very thought of the sweeping
north wind and the cold black water sent
a chill to his very marrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he whispered hesitatingly, &ldquo;perhaps
it might be that you&rsquo;d do well to stay
here.&rdquo; He was speaking to the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s tone showed
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to be hard out there, and&mdash;and
a bit dangerous. There are enough native
hunters. We have supplied them with
weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; The girl hesitated. There can be no
doubt but that there was an angry retort upon
her lips. She, after all, was but human, and
the moments that had just passed had been
tense ones.</p>
<p>One look at Johnny&rsquo;s honest, earnest face,
and the remark died unuttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not be worthy of my Scotch ancestry,&rdquo;
she said after a moment of silence, &ldquo;nor
of my grandfather, if I did not go when the
call comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, for a long time, as the click of
hoofs and clash of antlers grew louder, there
was silence in the place of hiding. As the girl
sat half hidden by willow branches the dry
leaves rustled to the time of her wildly beating
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Johnny whispered at last. &ldquo;There!
They have taken to the water. Now is the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creeping through the bushes until they were
at the brink of the water, they plunged silently
in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed hoarsely, &ldquo;The
Eskimos are doing their part nobly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. A thin line of hunters, hip deep
in the water, stood awaiting the great drove
of caribou who had come too far to turn back.</p>
<p>A half minute more, and an arrow sped;
another and yet another. Came a great splashing
and thrashing of waters. In his dying
frenzy a caribou beat an Eskimo into the
freezing water. The Eskimo, bow in hand,
was up in an instant and drawing to shoot
again.</p>
<p>So went the battle. Drenched to the skin by
water thrown upon him by the rushing herd,
the vanguard of which had even now reached
the bank, the old Scot stood his ground and
drew such a bow as never in his life had he
drawn before, while back to back with him the
girl did her part.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of nerve wrecking strain, and
all was over. Not, however, until food for
many a long moon was supplied for every
member of the strange little band.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We-e-l-l,&rdquo; said the old Scot as a half hour
later, dressed in dry fur garments, loaned him
by an Eskimo, he sat beside a willow bush
fire, &ldquo;with God&rsquo;s help we won. And our God
must be thanked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he dropped upon his knees and
offered up a prayer of thanks to the God who
provides all that is good. The Eskimos saw
and marveled, though perhaps not one of them
all understood. To this remote tribe no missionary
had ever come.</p>
<p>It was during the feast following the hunt
that a surprising and disturbing drama was
played out before the great roasting fire of
the tribe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>A hammer of perfectly good American make
lay upon the ground at Johnny&rsquo;s feet. He sat
munching a delicious bit of broiled steak and
wondering how that hammer had come all the
way to these barren lands, what dog team or
boat had brought it, how many fox skins it
had cost the Eskimo owner, and what use it
had ever been put to in a land where there are
neither boards nor nails, when of a sudden he
conceived of an immediate use for it. A young
Eskimo was attempting to obtain the juicy
marrow from the bones of a roast leg of caribou.
He was pounding the bone with a round
stone. The stone slipped from his grip. The
bone did not break. Again he tried without
success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me have it.&rdquo; Seizing the bone,
Johnny laid it upon a flat rock and crushed it
with a single blow of the hammer.</p>
<p>But what was this? As Johnny glanced
about him, he found a dark frown upon the
face of every Eskimo. As he offered the broken
bone with its rich marrow exposed to the
Eskimo boy, who a moment before had appeared
so eager to possess it, he was met with
a sudden;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No me! No me!&rdquo; Then the boy turned and
walked away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>It was strange. Johnny could not fathom
the mystery of the tribe&rsquo;s actions. From that
very moment they stood aloof. The joyous
noise and chatter of feasting was at an end.
They gathered in little groups, to speak to one
another in mumbled gutturals. Soon they
went to their tents, leaving only the three
whites by the dying embers of the feast fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I do?&rdquo; Johnny asked. &ldquo;Crushed
a bone with a hammer, tried to do the boy a
kindness, that was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may never know,&rdquo; the old Scot&rsquo;s tone
was low and serious. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be getting
away. Morning will do. We&rsquo;ll sleep. Then
we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer way to treat us,&rdquo; Johnny grumbled.
&ldquo;Here we have saved their lives, helped
them secure food to tide them over, and at
once they turn their backs upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must not judge them,&rdquo; said Duncan
slowly. &ldquo;Let God do that. They are but children.
To them every living creature and every
dead one too has a spirit. If you offend the
spirit of a dead caribou or a musk-ox or wolf,
he may do you great harm. There are a hundred
things you must do and a hundred others
you must not do. You who have lived all your
life in the light of civilization know little
enough of the torment that comes from being a
heathen. But we must sleep if we are to travel
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faye Duncan realized the truth of these
last words quite as well as her grandfather did.
Yet, for some reason, as she lay among the
deerskins with her grandfather breathing in
peaceful slumber nearby, she found herself unable
to sleep. The day had been an exciting
and trying one. The great crisis, in so far as
the Eskimos&rsquo; needs were concerned, had been
reached and passed.</p>
<p>She was about to fall asleep when she
thought again of Johnny&rsquo;s strange experience
with the young Eskimo and the hammer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>At that very moment she caught a slight
sound outside the tent. The sound, coming as
it did in the silence of the night, was disturbing.
Parting the tent flaps, she looked out.
The next moment she barely suppressed a
scream. The tent in which Johnny slept was
not ten feet from their own. Moonlight made
all bright as day. At that very moment an
Eskimo with a long knife in his hand was lifting
the skins at the back of Johnny&rsquo;s tent. As
he turned half about the girl recognized the
young Eskimo of the evening, he who had
refused to accept the marrow bone crushed by
Johnny&rsquo;s hammer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />THE DANCING SHADOW</h2>
<p>The tent Johnny slept in was a small one.
He slept in it alone. There could be no mistaking
the intent of the Eskimo with the long
knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will kill Johnny,&rdquo; the girl told herself,
gripping at her heart.</p>
<p>Her first impulse was to cry out. The cry
was stifled by the thought that the whole
village would be awakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might all turn upon us. Then what
chance have we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this flashed through the girl&rsquo;s mind. The
next instant she shot silently out of the tent.
Her bare feet left tracks in the snow but made
no sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Just as the Eskimo was creeping into
Johnny&rsquo;s tent, he felt himself seized from
behind and dragged violently backward. The
next instant a heavy body came crashing down
upon him. The knife flew from his hand. His
breath was knocked from him. He uttered one
low grunt and that was all.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later, powerful hands
gripped his shoulders while in a hoarse whisper
a voice spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he doing?&rdquo; It was the old Scot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try&mdash;trying&mdash;&rdquo; The girl struggled hard
to retain her composure. &ldquo;He had a long knife.
He was trying to kill Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the old Scot sat in silent
meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are ungrateful beasts!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s
low whisper was tense with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, girl, you must not think that! They
are but children, frightened children. Afraid,
that&rsquo;s what they are. Afraid of the trees in
the forest, of spirits that do not exist at all,
afraid, afraid. You must not blame them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Lifting the young Eskimo to his feet, he
pointed away toward the little village of native
tents, then gave him a gentle shove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny!&rdquo; he called in a low tone.</p>
<p>There came no answer.</p>
<p>A new terror gripped the girl&rsquo;s heart. What
if, after all, she had been too late?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slept through it all!&rdquo; the old Scot grumbled.
&ldquo;Have to shake him a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared within the tent. A moment
later, to her intense relief, Faye heard the two
conversing in low tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pack up,&rdquo; said the grandfather as he
emerged from the tent. &ldquo;Something has gone
amiss. Can&rsquo;t tell what. There&rsquo;s no use to stay.
Let&rsquo;s get away as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later, with a glorious yellow moon
hanging low in the sky to light their way, and
with Tico to lead them on, the little party
pushed off into the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>All through the remainder of the night and
the greater part of the day they moved forward.
A strange spectacle, a dog, an old man,
a young man and a girl moving over an endless
expanse of white, doing a forced march to
escape from those whom they had come to
save. They were following an entirely new
course, one which Johnny believed would bring
them to their journey&rsquo;s end, Timmie&rsquo;s cabin
and green gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive them, child. Forgive them,&rdquo; the
old Scot said as he read the look of unhappiness
on his granddaughter&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Learn to
pray the prayer of one much more worthy
than we, &lsquo;Father, forgive them; they know
not what they do.&rsquo; Some day a missionary will
come to them. He will teach them. Then they
will understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange to say, as they traveled away from
the tundra toward the forest at the foot of the
mountain, a brown spot like a drifting shadow
or prowling wolf followed them. When at last
they came to the edge of the forest and began
making camp, this shadowy figure did not
enter the forest, but sought out the shelter of
a cut bank of earth, to drop down upon a flat
rock and remain quite motionless for many
hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Later he wakened and prowled as a wolf
would have prowled. He did not come too
near the party of three, for all through the
long hours, as the girl slept curled up in her
blankets, the old man and the young man took
turns at making fire and guarding camp.</p>
<p>Toward dawn as Johnny sat half asleep by
the fire, the girl, waking from refreshing slumber,
sat up blinking at the fire to talk softly
of a vine clad cottage where squirrels came to
eat from one&rsquo;s hand, where daffodils cast their
fragrance to the air in the springtime, and old
fashioned roses bloomed in summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I may see you there some day,&rdquo; said
Johnny huskily. But as he recalled the way
they had come, it seemed very, very far away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />THE GREAT BANSHEE</h2>
<p>Next day they marched straight away over
the white expanse. A fog, hanging low over
the tundra, hid all but a narrow circle from
view. They traveled by the compass and the
ancient map Johnny had found in the cabin by
the river. That it was a long chance the boy
admitted to himself. What if the map were
wrong? Few maps of this country are accurate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t turn back now,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Have to take a chance. Take a chance.&rdquo; As
he repeated the words, to his surprise he found
that he was beginning to hate them. All his
life, so it seemed as he looked back upon it,
he had been taking chances. And what had
he gotten out of it? Precious little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>He thought of the cozy cottage the girl had
described to him so often. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the life,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;And yet they left it for this.
They took a chance. And here they are.&rdquo; For
the hundredth time he wondered why.</p>
<p>The land became more rolling as they advanced.
The tundra was left behind. This
the boy took for a good sign. &ldquo;Coming to the
mountains,&rdquo; he told himself. But were they?</p>
<p>As night fell the fog thickened. &ldquo;Going to
be dark as a dungeon,&rdquo; Gordon Duncan mumbled.
&ldquo;Tough luck. No wood for a fire. No
place to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he said was true. For the first time
Johnny felt regret for the course they had
taken. All about them was rolling ground.
Snow blanketed all. Cropping out here and
there were bunches of last year&rsquo;s grass, but
these poor wisps of wind-shrouded straw
would provide neither fire nor bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>When darkness had fully come, they yielded
to the inevitable. Having scooped away the
snow as best they could from a narrow patch
of turf, they spread out their blankets, sat
upon them while they ate a cold and cheerless
supper; then with Tico in their midst, huddling
together as best they could, they prepared
to defy the damp chill of a late winter
night in the Arctic.</p>
<p>It must have been some time past midnight
that Johnny, wakened by a low growl from
Tico, sat up to peer into the inky darkness and
listen.</p>
<p>What he heard caused his blood to run cold.
A faint chopping sound drifted in from the
dark. Now coming from the right, the left,
before him, behind, it seemed all about him
at once.</p>
<p>Putting out a hand, he shook the shoulder
of Gordon Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Wolves!&rdquo; he said in a tone that
was low and deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the girl asked, sitting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Wolves!&rdquo; Johnny repeated.</p>
<p>At once, above the chop-chop of the distant
enemy, he heard the girl&rsquo;s teeth chatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out the bows and arrows,&rdquo; said Gordon
Duncan. &ldquo;If only we had a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had!&rdquo; the girl echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll do for &rsquo;em!&rdquo; the old man declared
stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! There! Stop him!&rdquo; The girl sprang
to her feet.</p>
<p>She was too late. Tico had leaped away
into that darkness and fog.</p>
<p>A moment of suspense, then from out that
shadow-land came sounds of a terrific
encounter.</p>
<p>With a cry of dismay the girl leaped to her
feet and would have gone to the aid of her
faithful friend. But Gordon Duncan pulled
her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! child!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
do. We must stay together. It&rsquo;s our only
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many,&rdquo; he rumbled on. &ldquo;More
than I have ever known before. They do not
as a rule travel in packs, these white phantoms
of the Arctic. They go about in families.
But when caribou are passing they are sometimes
thrown together in packs. This is the
time when they are most dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Faye caught her breath as the
growl and howl of Tico was blended with the
yip-yip of wolves. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll kill him. What
can we do?&rdquo; She gripped Johnny&rsquo;s arm until
it hurt.</p>
<p>Fortunately this question did not need answering.
Fierce as the battle in the dark was,
it ended quite suddenly. A moment later the
dog came limping back. One shoulder was terribly
torn. His strength was completely gone.</p>
<p>Torn and bloody as he was, the girl gathered
him in her arms to wrap him in a blanket
and lay him down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave old boy!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>For a half hour after that they sat there
back to back waiting, listening, staring into the
dark, but seeing nothing.</p>
<p>Then a sudden gust of wind sweeping in
from the great unknown before them rolled
the fog away, to leave them gasping at the
size and ferocious appearance of the gray-white
creatures that surrounded them, a grim,
silent circle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>As if this were the sign for an advance, the
wolves rose each in his place and began a slow
advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan. &ldquo;When I give
the word, shoot the one before you, and for
the good of all, don&rsquo;t miss. It may mean
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poised each on a knee, back to back, they
set their bows and nocked their arrows, then
waited breathless for the old Scot&rsquo;s whispered
command.</p>
<p>To Johnny it seemed that he caught the
glint of a gray beast&rsquo;s eye before the whisper
came:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five seconds of suspense for steadied nerves,
then Johnny&rsquo;s arrow sped. Before him a gray
streak reared in air to fall sprawling and clawing
at nothing. The arrow had gone clean
through him, then glanced away over the
snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What luck for her and for the old man?&rdquo;
he asked himself. There was no time for
looking.</p>
<p>In this warfare there was no frightening din.
The wolves who had escaped the biting arrows
came straight on. A particularly ferocious
creature came stealing upon the boy. Now he
was ten paces away, now five, now three. A
spring and&mdash;</p>
<p>Again his bow twanged low. A second
arrow found its mark.</p>
<p>But now, before he could turn, before he
could as much as realize his danger, a gray
streak launched itself upon him.</p>
<p>Down he went. Snapping teeth and tearing
claws, and after that a shock. He was beneath
a combat, not a part of it. One frenzied
effort and he was free.</p>
<p>A glance told him much. The wolf had
leaped upon him. Maimed as he was, Tico
had come to his aid. The brave dog was down
now, the wolf at his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Lacking better weapons, the boy seized the
wolf by the throat and gripped him hard.
Trained as they were for every form of combat,
the grip of the boy&rsquo;s hands was like steel.</p>
<p>The struggle that followed was a terrific
one. Not daring to release his hold, yet fearing
every instant that he would be frightfully
torn by the beast&rsquo;s claws, Johnny hung on like
grim death.</p>
<p>Of a sudden the sight that appeared before
him drove him to desperation. As the girl
sprang back, a wolf leaped for her throat.
They went down together.</p>
<p>Quite forgetting self he released his hold on
the first wolf to seize the axe that in the
struggle had been thrown from their kit, and
with a single blow dispatched the beast that
threatened Faye Duncan&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>And through it all, like the ancient warrior
he was, Gordon Duncan remained in his place
calmly nocking arrows and sending them
crashing into the ribs of his enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more,&rdquo; Johnny panted, helping
the girl to her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;More!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? Just when the tide
seemed set against them there came a strange
roaring sound from the distance. This resembled
more than any other the call of a wild
beast, a challenge to battle.</p>
<p>Pausing, the gray streaks appeared to listen.
Then, one by one, they went trotting away
into the night.</p>
<p>Hardly a moment had elapsed before there
came a sharp yip of pain, another and yet another.
A moment of silence, then the night
was made hideous by the noise of battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what can it be?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s words
came in stifled whispers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your bows and arrows,&rdquo; commanded
Gordon Duncan. &ldquo;They may be back upon
us at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and that other monstrous thing!&rdquo;
Faye Duncan&rsquo;s nerves were shattered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Five out there.&rdquo; Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s voice
was calm. He was pointing in the direction
his arrows had sped.</p>
<p>Johnny was feeling a little ashamed of his
record when his eyes fell upon the wolf that
had attacked Tico. He was dead, strangled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad,&rdquo; he thought as he once more
gripped his bow and sought out an arrow.</p>
<p>There was, as it turned out, no need for
further worry. As they sat there shivering,
gripping bows with hands benumbed with
cold, they listened to the distant tumult rise,
then fade away into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All over,&rdquo; Johnny said at last, rising to
ease his stiffened limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;what could it have been?&rdquo; The girl
gripped his hand hard as he assisted her to
rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;as far as I can tell
was the great banshee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;Over there
not a quarter of a mile away is a small forest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>What he had said was true. Had they
marched but a quarter of a mile farther they
might have slept warm by a roaring fire which
would have served to keep the wolves away.</p>
<p>Needless to say, they were not long in packing
up and moving to this place of greater
safety and comfort.</p>
<p>A half hour later, seated before a fire that
fairly blistered their cheeks, the boy and girl,
conversing in awed whispers, discussed the
strange happenings of the night. In the meantime,
rolled in his blankets, and quite as if
nothing had happened, Gordon Duncan slept
the sleep of the just.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heart, did you say?&rdquo; Johnny nodded toward
the sleeping one. &ldquo;Did you say his heart
was bad? Mine was in my throat all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was mine. But he&mdash;he&rsquo;s different. He&mdash;he&rsquo;s
a Bruce,&rdquo; the girl whispered back. &ldquo;His
ancestry goes back to the famous Bruce of
old Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />THE ANSWERED CHALLENGE</h2>
<p>Had one chanced to have been passing over
that vast white expanse over which the three,
Johnny, Faye and Gordon Duncan, traveled
next day; had his eye caught sight of the dark
figure that, ever pressing forward in the fog,
continually dogged their footsteps, he must
have paused in amazement. A stranger creature
could scarcely be imagined.</p>
<p>Stooping low, lurching forward, moving in
little jerks, perhaps on four legs, perhaps on
two, his form at times seemed grotesquely
human. At others it seemed that the impossible
had happened, that some huge gorilla
from tropical wilds had found his way to this
land of ice and snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Had curiosity led one to inspect his footprints
in the snow, his amazement must have
grown. Measuring full twenty inches from
toe to heel, they resembled nothing quite so
much as the footprints of a fair sized polar
bear. Yet as everyone knows, the polar bear
lives upon the ice of the ocean. Seldom does
he wander more than a dozen miles inland. To
look for him here some hundreds of miles inland
was to give credence to that which has
never been.</p>
<p>This fearsome creature it was that uttered
a challenge to the wolves who were rapidly
getting the upper hand in the battle with
Johnny and his friends.</p>
<p>What was it that had turned them away?
Was this challenge but a call telling of the
past? Did the memory of other bloody frays
spur the wolves on? Or did they see in this
lone figure an easy victory and a toothsome
feast?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Whatever their hopes, they were soon
enough dashed to earth, for hardly had they
arrayed themselves in a grinning circle than
one after another of their number began biting,
clawing, snapping and yip-yipping in mortal
pain. When, in mad desperation they charged,
it was no better. Two of their number, being
seized by their bushy tails, had their brains
speedily dashed out against a rock. A third
was thrust through, and a fourth trampled into
pulp. Whereupon those few who remained
found safety in flight.</p>
<p>After tramping about for some little time
in what appeared to be wild fury, the strange
and terrible creature had seized five dead
wolves by their tails and, turning sharply to
the right, climbed the hill.</p>
<p>Before entering the dark fringe of scrub
forest, he had paused to stand blinking at the
campfire some distance away. Dropping the
wolves, he had taken a dozen steps toward the
fire. Then, appearing to take other counsel, he
had returned to his dead wolves, had given
them a vicious kick, had seized them again by
the tails, then disappeared into the dark depth
of the evergreen thicket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>As for the trio by the fire, they had realized
that some strange creature was afoot; but
being once more in possession of strong bows
and plenty of arrows, with bright flames dispelling
the darkness about them, they had felt
quite at ease and secure from any manner of
sudden attack. How little they really knew
of the ways of the wild in this strange
wilderness!</p>
<p>Next evening, as they lay before a roaring
campfire, chins propped on elbows, watching,
dreaming, half asleep, the two of them, the
boy and girl, they heard the old man stirring
in his sleep. Of a sudden he sat up. By his
staring eyes they knew that he spoke as one
in a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him the things were copper.&rdquo; His
voice was pitched and strained. &ldquo;But Timmie
said &lsquo;No, they are green gold.&rsquo; And he must
have been right, for he had worked with a
silversmith and had helped make alloys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said they were copper, gold and silver,
melted together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I said the natives had melted them together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said &lsquo;No, they&rsquo;re too ignorant for that.
God and nature made the alloy. Somewhere
in a great caldron of a volcano, long ago when
the earth was new, gold, silver and copper
were melted together and poured away in a
stream of green gold. And somewhere in the
hills there is a placer mine of green gold.
We&rsquo;ll find it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Timmie said that, and he&rsquo;s back there behind
the hills waiting still, and he knows where
the mine is. I&rsquo;ve dreamed that many times,
and it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s lips were open for a question, but
the girl held up a hand for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day has been hard,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;He is half asleep. Don&rsquo;t excite him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the old man had dropped
to his place deep among the blankets and save
for the crackling of the fire silence lay upon
hills and tundra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />A MYSTERIOUS VISIT IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Next morning they opened their eyes to a
new world. The fog was gone, the sun shone
bright. Up from the south had come a gentle
wind that brought with it the breath of spring.</p>
<p>Far away before them, like the jagged teeth
of a worn out saw, was a range of mountains.
The tops of these mountains still appeared to
smoke with the snow swept over the summits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what it&rsquo;s like up there,&rdquo; the girl
said to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In time you are sure to know,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Our trail leads over that range. May God
grant us a low pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well say that.&rdquo; Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s
eyes seemed to see things far distant and remote.
&ldquo;But as you say, the trail leads over
those mountains. There is no other way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>The week that followed will linger long in
the memory of Johnny Longbow and his smiling
companion of the trail, for it was spring,
and who could forget such an occasion?</p>
<p>In the Arctic winter lingers long. Spring
is thrice welcome. This year, creeping up
behind a veil of fog, it appeared to burst upon
them like a revelation.</p>
<p>The snow grew soft beneath their feet.
Little rivers began coursing away to the north.
The surfaces of lakes, long locked with ice,
glistened with water that buried the solid
depths of ice that still lingered.</p>
<p>Little snow-buntings, silent for long, began
their cheerful chee-chee, and far above in the
bluest of skies an early covey of wild ducks
winged their silent way.</p>
<p>The first touch of spring brought out small
game in abundance. Snowshoe rabbits, leaving
their hiding places, hopped about in a leisurely
fashion. Ptarmigan were so numerous
that the wandering bowmen grew expert in
the art of beheading them with a well shot
broadhead arrow. And what could be sweeter
than a ptarmigan roasted over a glowing bed
of coals?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Once, creeping through tall dead grass of a
year&rsquo;s standing, they came upon a flock of
gray ducks that had come all the way from
the southland.</p>
<p>As he smiled over the breast of a fine duck
that evening Johnny&rsquo;s face suddenly sobered.
He had bitten upon something that had nearly
cost him a tooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shot,&rdquo; he said as he produced a mashed
bit of lead. &ldquo;Someone shot at him way down
there where there is no ice and snow, and he
brought this, a message from another land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment as he sat dreaming, eyes half
closed, he thought of himself as a young native
of the land, the old man the last patriarch of
his tribe and the girl the last link of a vanishing
race.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he smiled as he wakened from his
revery. &ldquo;Strange world! In a month we will
be with white men, living as they live.&rdquo; But
would they?</p>
<p>With all the hunting and their keen enjoyment
of the spring, they did not neglect the
trail. Each day brought them nearer to the
range of snow blown mountains. Each hour
hastened the time when they must try the pass.</p>
<p>Sometimes at night by the campfire they
spoke of it in awed whispers. At other times,
under bright midday skies, they laughingly
talked of the long slide they would take when
they reached the other side. How little they
knew of that which lay before them.</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan thought only of Timmie and
his green gold. Faye Duncan lived most for
the care and protection of the kindly old man
she loved more than her own life. Johnny
dreamed strange dreams of gold, fortune, and
a dark haired handsome Scotch girl. At times
he wondered why they had feared to meet a
fellow human being. That wonder was fading.
Growing ever stronger was his desire to solve
the mystery of Timmie and his green gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just over the mountains, and we&rsquo;ll know,&rdquo;
he told himself many times.</p>
<p>So at last they reached the foothills of those
vast and silent mountains, and their troubles
began.</p>
<p>As they passed the lower levels game vanished.
Only once in two days did they see a
rabbit. Then it escaped into the brush.</p>
<p>At the end of three days, after skirting many
a spring-born freshet and creeping about a
score of cliffs, they arrived at the base of a
mountain, the lowest of all the range, but
startling in its whiteness and immensity.
There, sore footed and weary, they built another
campfire and sat down to a meal of
steaming coffee and frozen berries.</p>
<p>The girl looked at Johnny. There was a
question in her eyes. &ldquo;Dare we try the
mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is three days&rsquo; travel back to the land of
game,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Can it be worse ahead?
Will he turn back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>He looked at the grizzled old Scot, who as
ever sat dozing by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he live to&mdash;to see the other side of
the mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can only hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time after that they sat there in
silence. What were the girl&rsquo;s thoughts?
Johnny would gladly have known. As for himself,
he was thinking of the possibility of sudden
tragedy for the old Scot and of their
battle to win their way back to the haunts of
civilized man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a burial place for such a man!&rdquo; he
thought to himself. &ldquo;A whole unmolested
mountain for a tomb!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he thought a moment later, &ldquo;as she
has said, we must hope. It would break her
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day they started early. There was
hope in each heart that they might make the
pass before sunset and camp for the night on
the other side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>One thing was in their favor; they soon
passed from the zone of spring into the high
level where winter still reigned. No longer
was the snow soft under their tread, no longer
were they obliged to skirt the banks of streams
for a safe passage. There were no streams.
All was ice and snow and barren rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at it,&rdquo; Johnny said after an hour of
desperate struggle up an all but perpendicular
wall. &ldquo;Not a shrub, not a scrub birch or fir.
Barren as the hills of doom. No living creature
could be here. Tonight we go supperless and
without a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faye Duncan shuddered. It was mid-afternoon,
and the smoking mountain peak still
loomed far above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wood, no food, no shelter!&rdquo; Gladly
would she have turned back. But one look at
the grim look of determination on the old
Scot&rsquo;s face sealed her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He crossed these mountains in his prime,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;He will cross them again
or die.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Johnny pointed excitedly toward
a sloping waste of barren rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something moving over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning her about and pointing over his
shoulder, he said, &ldquo;See! Just beyond that
great boulder, something white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;A mountain goat!
Oh, Johnny, can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can, or my name is not Johnny Longbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vision of a feast of wild goat&rsquo;s steak done
to a turn floated before his eyes. In his excitement
he quite forgot that they had no wood.</p>
<p>Carefully they prepared their attack. He
would climb the narrow ledge to the right and
come out above the goat. She would work
round to the left and station herself among
the rocks prepared to cut off his retreat up a
narrow run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>For a half hour after that Johnny climbed
from rock to rock until, with a deep intake of
breath, he bent his bow, nocked his arrow, then
of a sudden stood up.</p>
<p>His heart went wild as he saw the goat not
fifty yards away. As he stood there hope,
despair and high resolve fought for first place
in his soul. The result was a bad shot. Or was
it? He could not tell. All he knew was that
the nimble beast leaped high in air, then went
racing away.</p>
<p>A second arrow followed the first. On such
slopes, among such rocks, there could be no
hope of recovering an arrow.</p>
<p>Sitting limply down upon a rock, the boy
watched the great bobbing horns disappear
from sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missed!&rdquo; he muttered, then turning, began
making his way back.</p>
<p>Sitting in a sheltered spot at the back of a
great rock that overlooked the narrow gorge,
Faye Duncan, as she waited and watched,
thought of many things, of her grandfather
and Johnny Longbow, of Timmie and his mysterious
green gold, of her home and her own
cozy room there. Her heart warmed at this
last thought, but chilled again as she looked
up at the smoking crest which they must cross.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will we make it? Can we do it? Well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden she sprang to her feet. There
had come to her alert ears a sound. It seemed
close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goat!&rdquo; Seizing her bow, she nocked
a broadhead and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there. There.&rdquo; Her hand trembled.
The great horned creature was making
straight for her.</p>
<p>Not a hundred yards away, he was coming
straight on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he seen me? Would a wild goat charge
his enemy?&rdquo; She did not know. Her heart
stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be sure of my shot,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Bracing herself, she waited. Now he was
eighty yards away, now sixty, now forty, and
now&mdash;now&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>A second more, and her broadhead arrow
would have flown. But of a sudden the wild
creature&rsquo;s forelegs crumpled beneath him and
he fell with a great rattling of horns, to go
rolling over and over down a twenty-foot
embankment.</p>
<p>Fleet as the wind, the girl leaped clear of
her retreat and away down that slope. &ldquo;He
may merely have stumbled, may be up and
away.&rdquo; Little she knew of wild goats, whose
feet are surer than any other thing in life. The
goat was dead. Johnny&rsquo;s first arrow had
pierced him through and through.</p>
<p>One look at the fallen creature was enough.
His eyes were glazed in death.</p>
<p>Climbing to the top of a boulder, she cupped
her hands to give forth a long, shrill call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who-hoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three times this was repeated. Then came
the answer echoing back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has heard. He will come.&rdquo; She smiled.</p>
<p>That evening they ate goat&rsquo;s meat prepared
by cutting it into narrow strips and allowing
it to freeze. That night they slept huddled
together for warmth beneath a rude snow hut
which Johnny, under the old man&rsquo;s directions,
was able to build against a wall of rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is sure,&rdquo; Johnny said as he prepared
for rest. &ldquo;There is no need for maintaining
a watch to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was destined to have another thought
regarding this next morning. Beside the pile
of goat&rsquo;s meat they had left carelessly on a
rock, he saw a single footprint. The goatskin
and a portion of the meat was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did us no harm,&rdquo; he told Faye as he
pointed in astonishment at the footprint. &ldquo;We
still have more meat than we can carry. And
the skin was worth nothing to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that creature!&rdquo; she said with a shudder.
&ldquo;Look! The footprint is twice the length of
a man&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are no toe marks,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; There was an air of mystery
in his tone. &ldquo;Remember that creature
that defied the wolves that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same; the great banshee!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Here indeed was a mystery. But graver
matters called for their attention. In spite
of all they could do they had come near perishing
with cold. They must be off the mountain
before the end of the day, or tragedy was sure
to overtake them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />ON THE TRAIL OF THE GREAT BANSHEE</h2>
<p>Mid-afternoon of that day found them at the
crest of the mountain, caught in the grip of
such a storm as one dreams of but seldom
meets in real life.</p>
<p>A sixty-mile gale drove particles of snow
fine as white sand and cutting as steel into
their burning cheeks. When they attempted
to go forward it was as if they were leaping
against a fine meshed but unbreakable net.
They could but drop on hands and knees and
crawl. When they went with the wind they
were appalled by the push and drive of it and
by the sweeping whirls of snow that leaping
fifty, a hundred feet in air, appeared nearly to
reach to the very sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the girl in a half sob, &ldquo;I know
why these mountains appear to smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could find a way down,&rdquo; said
Johnny as he lent an arm to Gordon Duncan,
who was struggling against the wind.</p>
<p>Of a sudden a burst of wind more terrible
than ever seized the girl and sent her whirling
down the white slope toward the unknown
abyss beyond.</p>
<p>In the nick of time Johnny grasped the belt
of her mackinaw. Throwing himself flat behind
a low rock, he clung there like grim
despair until the wind lost its power and the
girl was drawn back to safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you remember,&rdquo; the girl panted, &ldquo;we
were going to try to slide down on the
o&mdash;other side. I nearly did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game to the last,&rdquo; Johnny thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your face is freezing!&rdquo; Snatching off
her deerskin mittens, the girl held snow
against his cheeks to draw out the frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s done for this time.
And now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must find a way down,&rdquo; said
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tico,&rdquo; the boy said, speaking to the dog
cowering at his feet, &ldquo;show us the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if understanding his mission, the dog
began creeping forward along the ridge.
Knowing nothing better to do, his human companions
followed.</p>
<p>Ten yards, twenty, thirty, battered at and
buffeted, faces cut by snow, knees bruised from
creeping over rocks and hard packed snow,
they moved forward.</p>
<p>Now they paused to thaw cheeks and noses.
And now, as a ruder blast struck them, they
flattened themselves against the snow and
clung together like grim death. But still they
struggled on.</p>
<p>But what was this? The dog had disappeared
in the snow fog before them. Plucking
up hope, they redoubled their efforts. Another
twenty yards found them half sheltered by a
ledge; another, and they were standing on
their feet pushing forward down a gentle
incline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray! We win!&rdquo; the boy shouted. &ldquo;Good
for Tico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, beneath a cave-like sheltering
ledge they paused to rest their trembling
limbs and to take counsel for the future.</p>
<p>They were resting there in silence when of a
sudden, some distance away, they heard the
dog growl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something dangerous or he wouldn&rsquo;t
growl like that. Come on,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a footprint in the snow,&rdquo; said
Johnny a moment later as they came to the
spot where the dog stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such a footprint!&rdquo; said the girl, shaking
as if seized with a sudden chill. &ldquo;What can
it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as before,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the great banshee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, seeing that the girl was truly frightened,
he added: &ldquo;That, I am convinced, is the
footprint of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But look! Twice the size of our own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Eskimos have many legends regarding
giants. It has always been supposed that these
legends had to do with white men from the
south. But supposing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe such things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is one to believe? There is the footprint
in the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan, who now
joined them, &ldquo;this is no time for fairy stories.
The night will be upon us. Let&rsquo;s be going
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they descended they marveled more and
more at the downward passage Tico had
discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if the giants had really cut the way
through,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the girl as they paused after
an hour of steady tramping. &ldquo;There is another
footprint in the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that they all fell silent. Night was
descending upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could have a fire to-night,&rdquo; the
girl said wearily. &ldquo;I feel as if I should die of
fear in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; cried Johnny as they rounded
a turn. &ldquo;The good banshee has granted your
wish. There is a scrub forest not ten minutes
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. The gnarled trees, twisted
and bent, were scarce six feet tall, but dead
trunks were dry as tinder. Soon, in a sheltered
spot, they had built a roaring fire and were
preparing to boil coffee and roast the goat&rsquo;s
meat they had packed across the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan, &ldquo;we
shall see the valley of green gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />DOWN WITH THE AVALANCHE</h2>
<p>The sun was setting over a wilderness of
snow and winter-washed, bleak, bare land, as
late next day the three travelers, rounding a
towering granite crag, came at last into full
view of all that lay beyond. It was the promised
land, the valley of green gold.</p>
<p>For a full moment they stood there, motionless.
The scene that lay before them, glistening
snow turned to a rosy hue by the setting
sun, crags, torrents, mists, rushing little
streams, all that go to make mountains, valleys
and rugged hills, all that is the spring
break-up in a land of ice and snow was here.
Many days before they had started for this
divide. Weeks of toilsome travel, weeks of
perils and adventure had come into their lives
since Gordon Duncan had said, &ldquo;There is the
knife. The trail leads up this ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Now they were at the divide, ready to descend
into a wild valley. And why? Perhaps
Gordon Duncan knew all. Johnny and Faye
knew little enough. Yet, with the tender feeling
of youth for an old man who was perhaps
on his last long journey, his final joyous adventure,
they had followed his lead. Now here
they stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great river yonder,&rdquo; said Johnny,
lifting his field glasses to his eyes. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised if it were the headwaters of the
Yukon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something
moving down there. Here, tell me what
it is. It seems to be marooned on that little
island in midstream. Water&rsquo;s overflowing the
ice. Water must be rising. May flood the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl took the glasses and with steady
gaze studied the spot he pointed out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>As for Gordon Duncan, he stood there erect,
motionless, seeing all that lay before him,
mountains, rivers, hills and valleys. He appeared
to search for that which he did not see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should be to the right down there,&rdquo; he
mumbled once. &ldquo;Can it be that I have mistaken
the pass? No. That could not be. Yet
if it were there one would see a curl of smoke.
It is growing dusk. Time for the evening
meal.&rdquo; He shaded his eyes to look again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> something moving there,&rdquo; the girl
said to Johnny. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out what it is.
Might be caribou; might be Indians. Can&rsquo;t
tell. In the morning light we can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians.&rdquo; The thought gave Johnny a start.
Even today in this wild out-of-the-way corner
of the world, Indians were not to be trusted
too far. In a fit of anger, in a moment of
greed, they might kill. And who would be the
wiser?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t camp here,&rdquo; Johnny said as a cold
wind, sweeping across the perpetual snow of
the mountain side chilled him to the bone.
&ldquo;Have to go on down. May find a sheltering
ledge.&rdquo; He slung his pack over his shoulder,
then motioned the older man to guide them on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way is down,&rdquo; Gordon Duncan said
huskily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I know. Young man, your
foot is surer than mine. Lead on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Johnny took up the task of trail blazer,
and even as his eyes worked out a passage here
and a detour there, his mind went back to
that day when he first met Faye Duncan, the
day on which they killed their first caribou.
Woven with his thoughts of that which had
happened then were wonders regarding the
creatures moving about on the river island,
and Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s purpose in bringing
them on this wild chase into the unknown.</p>
<p>An hour later in a sheltered nook they
pitched their small tents and built a crackling
fire of scrub fir trees. Over the fire they
cooked the last of their goat&rsquo;s meat, and
boiled coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>After that for a time they sat over their
crude table of rocks to stare away over the
moonlit mountains. Johnny and the girl were
wondering about many things. The great
river, the island with living creatures moving
upon it, their strange mission in this stranger
land, all these came in for their share of perplexing
thought.</p>
<p>It was quite wonderful as they sat there
thinking of all that had gone before, and that
which lay about them. On the far side was a
storm, on the crest a wild tumult, but down
here was quiet and peace.</p>
<p>There were no clouds. The moon came up.
Everywhere were purple shadows, silent and
deep. Not a breath of air stirred. Not a wild
creature in all that land but appeared to be
at rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like all of life,&rdquo; Gordon Duncan said
solemnly. &ldquo;At times we find ourselves in the
midst of terrible trouble, storms of life. We
may have companions in these troubles, or
they may be hidden away, our own secret
troubles. In any case, it is quite wonderful
to feel that about us, standing shoulder to
shoulder with us, are friends ready at an instant&rsquo;s
notice to reach out a helping hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Much of the meaning of life is just here.&rdquo;
His tone became more thoughtful. &ldquo;Life,
after all, is a storm and in a way the worst of
storms, for many of us haven&rsquo;t the faintest
notion whither we are bound. One thing alone
we know, we must struggle on. The one thing
that makes the struggle far more than worth
while is the splendid human companionship
we enjoy while we are in the midst of the
storm. As we travel on, it seems there is
always a hand outstretched to guide us home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hand outstretched,&rdquo; Faye said, thinking
out loud. Before her mind&rsquo;s vision she saw
again the glistening slope down which she
had been about to glide when Johnny seized
her and drew her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back from what?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>
<p>As if in answer, Johnny said, &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes followed the direction of his arm.
Then her cheeks went white.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>The moon, rising higher and higher, had
brought out the upper ridges of the mountain
they had crossed. At the point where she had
lost her footing and had been saved from a
sudden plunge by the boy, the snow, blown
over and beaten down by countless storms,
had taken on the form of an inverted saucer.
The edge of this great saucer hung more than
a hundred feet over the edge of a gigantic
precipice. From the outer rim of this snow
saucer to the rocky ridges below was thousands
of feet. The girl&rsquo;s head whirled, her
heart went sick at thought of that which she
had escaped by so little. One second more
of downward glide over that glistening saucer,
and she would have been lost forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An arm reaching out to one during the
storms of life,&rdquo; she said in a tone that was deep
with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not think of it,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;See
how the moonlight plays on the river far
below. It has painted a path of gold, a path
that leads beyond doubt to home and the little
cottage you love.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me,&rdquo; he said a moment
later, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take a stroll along the ledge.
Sort of want&mdash;want to think a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a considerable distance the shelving
rocky ledge led upward. Johnny followed it,
to find himself at last standing upon a natural
platform twenty feet square.</p>
<p>From this point the whole world seemed
spread out before him in the moonlight. White
stretches of snow, black piles of rock, gleaming
ribbons of water that were creeks and
rivers, all these he saw as in a dream.</p>
<p>Throwing back his shoulders, he took in
three breaths of fresh air. A whirring of wings
told that wild ducks were passing. Spring was
here. And with spring a young man dreams
of work, success, power. The life he had lived
during the past few weeks seemed, as he
looked at it now, quite purposeless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>He had been helping someone else solve
mysteries and run down one or two for himself.
But one who spends his life running
down mysteries gets nowhere. One must think
of his future. True, no one was dependent
upon his earnings. Yet, sometime, someone
was likely to be. He meant to have a home of
his own. Money earned and saved paved the
way to such a future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; He saw the face of Gordon
Duncan, and the eager, anxious look of the
girl who, without perhaps knowing it, had
come to depend upon his wisdom, skill and
strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of
having a purpose to your every act? What&rsquo;s
youth for if not for adventure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning his back upon the moon and the
shimmering valley below, he went tramping
back toward camp.</p>
<p>As he rounded a rocky point he came in
sight of the cheery glow of their campfire. He
saw a short cut back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right over there,&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;straight across that broad stretch of winter
packed snow. What could be sweeter? I&rsquo;ll
use my bow as an Alpine staff. Not a bit of
danger. Be there in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having been raised on the plains, Johnny
knew little of the mountains. The great broad
bank of snow he was to cross, ten feet deep
here, twenty there, was indeed hard packed by
beating winter winds. But beneath it, forces
of nature had long been at work. Little
trickles of melted snow, working from pebble
to pebble, had worn narrow beds beneath the
bank. These tiny trickles had become rushing
rivulets. The great snowbank, clinging there
to the steep mountain side, was gradually
being undermined.</p>
<p>Totally unconscious of all this, Johnny
marched blithely along down the white incline.</p>
<p>Here the grade was steeper and he was
obliged to move with care. There the surface
was like a great broad pavement. Here he
paused to admire the reflection of the moon in
a dark pool of water, and there stood staring
away at a wavering light far out and below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might be on that river island. May be
Indians,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Faint and from some distance down came a
disturbing sound. It was like some heavy body
plunging down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could that have been?&rdquo; He quickened
his pace.</p>
<p>Coming to a broad break in the snow, he
gripped his bow securely and leaped the chasm.</p>
<p>Was it the shock of his landing that
loosened the avalanche? Who can say?
Enough that at this precise moment there
came a solemn threatening rumble, and the
boy felt himself moving downward.</p>
<p>With one last effort, he threw himself flat,
gripped his bow, then committed his spirit to
the great Father of all. The next instant the
cutting of cold air across his face told him he
was going down, down, down&mdash;to what?</p>
<p>This lasted for a space of seconds that
seemed years. Then came a sudden shock;
after that silence and darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Faye Duncan and her grandfather, as was
their custom before retiring for the night,
were partaking of a cup of tea when the sudden
thunder of the avalanche reached their
ears. A serious, questioning look passed
from the girl to her grandsire as they sprang
to their feet. The glance was returned. Not
a word was spoken.</p>
<p>As they stood there listening, intent,
motionless, a swift cold breath of air fanned
their cheeks, a thin film of snow gathered
on their garments. That was all.</p>
<p>It was all over in a moment. Once more
the vast silence of the wilderness at night
settled about them.</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan was by nature a silent man.
Suspense only served to deepen that silence.
For a full hour he sat there beside his granddaughter
while the firelight played across his
immobile face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he comes to-night,&rdquo; he said at last,
rising slowly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be late. We&rsquo;ll heap the
fire high. It will serve as a beacon. We&mdash;we
can look in the morning,&rdquo; he added slowly.
&ldquo;By night the mountain is treacherous. Nothing
is to be gained.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Faye Duncan lay beneath her blankets a
long time before sleep came. In her mind
many questions revolved themselves like the
turn of a heathen prayer wheel. Where was
Johnny Longbow? Why did he not return?
What was it that had brought them so far
into the wilderness? An old man&rsquo;s dream of
treasure. Her grandfather had said it should
be near here. Was it? Was their search to
end so soon? Would Johnny return? If not,
what then? What of those moving creatures
on the river island?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river is rising,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Soon that low island will be flooded. They
must leave it. If they are human beings, I
hope they have a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Then a thought struck her all of a heap.
Her grandfather would find in the need of
these people, if need there was, a mission.
Would this delay their search, their return?
She hoped not. Of late the wilderness had
seemed to be closing in upon her, shutting her
from the world she had known. She longed
for the return to their cozy cabin where the
first snowdrops would be blooming and all
the air fragrant with spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must see this through,&rdquo; she told
herself stoutly. &ldquo;One can not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts broke off. Gordon Duncan
was talking in his sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found it together.&rdquo; His words were
distinct. &ldquo;I was sure it was a great discovery.
I urged him to help me bring it out.
I talked of money, of the name he would have.
But he would not listen. He was a recluse.
He would not come. I went for food. He&rsquo;s
there still&mdash;out there in the hills alone. For
long years I could not recall the way. But
now I know. It all came to me there by the
tree of the knife. I shall see him soon. He
will still be there. He is a recluse&mdash;a recluse&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;
His voice trailed off into nothingness,
and again the oppressive silence of the
mountains brooded over all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />THE GIANT HUNCHBACK</h2>
<p>Before she fell asleep that night Faye
found herself wondering about many things.
Why had her grandfather brought her so far
into the white wilderness? Why had he not
told her of the earlier chapters of his life?
Who was the man of mystery, her grandfather&rsquo;s
friend of other days? What was the
treasure he had babbled of in his sleep? Above
all, her mind was troubled by the strange
disappearance of Johnny Longbow. Had the
avalanche swallowed him up? Had he slipped
from some ice encrusted ledge? Had he
fallen into the hands of unfriendly whites or
Indians?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>In the midst of all these puzzlings she
fell into troubled sleep to dream of bleak
mountains, rushing floods and wild Arctic
storms.</p>
<p>Day was breaking when on awakening she
struggled to an upright position to gaze wildly
about her.</p>
<p>Realizing at last where she was, she took
a moment for recalling that which had befallen
them on the previous day, then sprang
into action.</p>
<p>After a hasty toilet she kindled a fire and
put coffee on to boil.</p>
<p>Next she took up Johnny&rsquo;s light field glass,
and walking to a point of vantage, began
sweeping the horizon.</p>
<p>She was searching for some sign of their
lost companion. The wide circling of her
glass continued for a full three minutes.
Then of a sudden, as her lips parted and her
face became tense, the glass remained directed
at one spot, far off in the river valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather! Grandfather!&rdquo; she exclaimed
after ten tense seconds, &ldquo;Wake up!
There are people on that river island. They
are marooned! The river is rising. The
floods will reach them and sweep them away
unless help comes. We must go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan was now on his feet. Seizing
the glass, he studied the situation for a
moment, then said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. We must help them. At
once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;We have no
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God will show us the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later, disregarding the water
boiling for coffee, carrying only their bow
and quiver of arrows apiece, they went racing
down the mountain side.</p>
<p>The memory of that race will remain
long with Faye Duncan. Slipping, sliding,
now racing, now gliding and now creeping,
they made their way downward. Now their
path was a plateau, now a cliff, and now the
bed of a boiling, rushing stream. Now they
seemed about to send an avalanche sweeping
down. And now, as they attempted to cross
a turbulent torrent they appeared in greater
danger than those whom they would rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>In the end they won the race, only to find
themselves standing at the river&rsquo;s brink with
a hundred yards of rushing water between
them and those whom they would save, and
with no apparent means of rendering any aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What indeed?&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan, a
look of despair coming over his face.</p>
<p class="tb">Had Faye chanced to have wakened from
her sound sleep of the previous night at a
time shortly after one in the morning; had the
moonlight been bright enough and her glass
strong enough to enable her to see clearly for
the distance of a mile, she might have witnessed
as strange a drama as ever was played
upon the white stage of the North. As it was,
only the eye of the All-Seeing One witnessed
that which passed at the end of the great
snow pile created by the avalanche Johnny
Longbow&rsquo;s foot had loosened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>By some strange bit of Providence the boy
was not buried by the avalanche that had
carried him down. He was struck on the
head by a block of hard packed snow ice, and
rendered unconscious. After that he was
pitched and tumbled, knocked, bumped and
beaten until his body was a mass of bruises.
He was left at last, still unconscious and half
dead, at the foot of the now silent, inanimate
avalanche that had been his undoing.</p>
<p>At this hour two figures, approaching from
opposite directions, came near to the unconscious
boy. One was a great gaunt brown
beast. The other, a short, squat, powerful
figure, might at a moment&rsquo;s notice have
puzzled a skilled man of science. Was he
man or beast? Was he an Indian of these
wilds, or was he some giant ape escaped from
captivity?</p>
<p>He wore clothes. This marked him for a
man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Truth was, the creature was a man. Yet
so bent and twisted was his body, so bowed
his crooked legs, so ugly and distorted his
visage that one might have traveled America
from end to end without meeting with another
being such as he.</p>
<p>As his small eyes caught sight of the unconscious
boy, they gleamed like twin stars.
Johnny&rsquo;s stout hand still gripped his bow.
This strong bow was a prize in any land.
How much more in a wilderness! Not less
valuable was the quiver of arrows that lay
nearby. And if he were dead? But then, too
often in wild lands it matters little that one
is not dead. If he were to be found helpless,
this is enough to excuse robbery.</p>
<p>The curious deformed creature was bending
over the boy when of a sudden his alert
ear caught some slight sound, a scraping
perhaps, or a sniffing breath. Looking up
quickly, he found himself staring into the
burning eyes of a great gaunt bear which had,
beyond doubt, been disturbed from his hibernating
sleep by the thundering avalanche.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Some form of grizzly, a silver-tip perhaps,
this bear promised to be a formidable foe. At
such a time of half stupor and intense hunger
he must be doubly dangerous.</p>
<p>The Indian took one step backward. Then
he paused. The next instant, with hands
that were as powerful as man has known, and
fingers as cunning, he wrenched the bow from
the unconscious boy&rsquo;s grasp and sent an arrow
crashing into the gaunt beast&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>For a period of five minutes after that he
stood motionless, watching the dying throes
of the bear.</p>
<p>Then, with no apparent effort, he lifted the
boy to a position of ease across his deformed
shoulders, picked up the bow and arrows, and
went marching away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>He tramped doggedly on for the better
part of the night. Just as dawn was breaking
he arrived at the door of a long, low,
crudely built cabin. Depositing his burden by
the door, he went inside.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Faye Duncan and her grandfather watched
the movements of the frightened natives on
the little island for some time before anything
like a solution of the problem offered itself
to their minds.</p>
<p>That these people were natives they did
not doubt. Whether they were savage or half
civilized they did not for a moment question.
They were human. That was enough. If a
way offered, they must be saved.</p>
<p>Racing along beside the men were several
dogs. Close to the water&rsquo;s edge were well
packed sleds. The constant rising of the
water was shown by the fact that twice the
sleds had to be drawn back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of an hour,&rdquo; said Gordon
Duncan. &ldquo;Perhaps not that. What&rsquo;s to be
done?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Suddenly the girl&rsquo;s face lighted with a
gleam of hope. Quickly drawing off her
sweater that had protected her from many
an Arctic gale, she did a strange thing.
Having cut the end of a sleeve squarely off
at the lower end to break the binding stitches,
she began rapidly unraveling it and dropping
the yarn in a loose pile upon the ground.</p>
<p>Not understanding at all, her grandfather
stood watching in unfeigned astonishment.</p>
<p>When the entire sleeve became a mere coil
of yarn on the earth, she looked away at the
rushing flood.</p>
<p>She seemed to measure the distance with
her eye. Apparently satisfied with the results,
she suddenly took up her quiver, selected
an arrow, then began tying one end of the
yarn tightly about it.</p>
<p>Then Gordon Duncan understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;May God
grant you success!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Setting the arrow to her bow, the girl, aiming
high, sent the arrow with the slender
line attached speeding across the flood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>That the keen eyed natives on the opposite
shore saw and, to an extent, understood, was
shown by their sudden grouping beside a
long pine that grew at the water&rsquo;s brink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fell short,&rdquo; the girl murmured, a note of
despair creeping into her voice.</p>
<p>The distance was greater than she thought.
The arrow, having curved to the flood,
dropped with a splash and being caught
in the grip of dark waters, went speeding
downstream.</p>
<p>Faye drew the stout yarn line in slowly.
It was wet now, heavy. No use to make
another try.</p>
<p>But Gordon Duncan carried in his veins
the blood of the mighty Bruce. He was
engaged in the business of unraveling Faye&rsquo;s
other sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine shot, Lass,&rdquo; he rumbled,
&ldquo;but for a burst of power take an arm of
old hickory like Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>It was a great deal for the modest old man
to say. That it was not too much was proven
when, a moment later, his arrow, with the last
available coil of yarn sailing fast and low,
lost itself in the branches of the lone pine
on the opposite shore. A shout of admiration
and triumph came from the distant shore.</p>
<p>That the natives knew what was expected
of them was soon shown. After a moment
of wild scrambling in which dogs were
trampled upon and sleds overturned, they
began the business of tying together a long
cord of their own. And this was of strong
rawhide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only the yarn holds,&rdquo; Faye murmured
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said the old Scot. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas
a present to your mother from a French
Canadian granny. Homespun from native
wool it is. Nae bit o&rsquo; shoddy there!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">That the curious creature who had sent
Johnny&rsquo;s arrows crashing into the gaunt
bear&rsquo;s side, and so beyond doubt saved the
boy&rsquo;s life, had not carried him that distance
to his own rude cabin without purpose, was
shown the moment he arrived there. What
that purpose might be remained locked within
his own misshapen breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Having entered his cabin, he took down
first a rude soapstone jar of water, and second
a skin bottle half filled with some liquid.</p>
<p>After feeling the boy over carefully, possibly
for broken bones, he sat up with a grunt
of apparent satisfaction. He next poured
the water over Johnny&rsquo;s neck and bare
shoulders. And now, with beady eyes searching
for signs of life, he removed the wooden
stopper from the leather bottle and poured
a part of its contents down the boy&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>What was this strange liquid? Native
medicine, beyond doubt. Carefully selected
leaves, stems, roots and bulbs, boiled over a
slow fire perhaps. Who knows? That it
was a potent drug one was soon enough to
know. Two minutes had not passed before
the boy groaned, moved, sat up, stared about
him, then asked in a dazed fashion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Without answering his question, if indeed
he understood it at all, the brawny hunchback
lifted him from the earth and, with
greatest care, carried him inside to deposit
him upon a litter of skins in the corner.</p>
<p class="tb">Of a sudden, as Gordon Duncan waited the
results of the preparations that were going
forward on the river island, his eyes wandered
to the mountainside, and his gaze became
transfixed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabin!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Timmie&rsquo;s
cabin! And smoke is coming from the chimney!
He is still there! Still there!&rdquo; At
once he became greatly agitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a recluse!&rdquo; he went on rapidly. &ldquo;A
natural recluse, but a good man and a faithful
companion. He once saved my life. And
to think&mdash;&rdquo; he drew his hand across his eyes,
&ldquo;to think that this moment of all those long
years I am able to look upon that cabin
again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>He took a step forward as if to scale the
mountain. But Faye tugged at his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Without our
aid they may perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo; He became calm. &ldquo;I must
wait. Our duty is always to do the greatest
good to largest numbers. It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s law. All
things in His good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, he watched with ever increasing
anxiety the preparations that were going forward
on the little island across the waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />SAVED BY A LINE</h2>
<p>Exactly a quarter of an hour, measured by
Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s large and ancient timepiece,
elapsed before the natives on the island
announced by a wild burst of shouting that
they were ready for Gordon Duncan and Faye
to haul away on the line of homespun yarn.</p>
<p>Faye found her heart beating wildly as she
seized the slender line that spanned the rushing
water. Well enough she knew that should
this line fail them, a half score of lives must
be lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And life,&rdquo; she told herself as her lips
moved in silent prayer, &ldquo;life is such a precious
heritage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, steadily, they began to haul away.
Moment by moment the tug on that slender
line grew stronger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Now as the current rising in mad fury
redoubled its efforts to defeat them, it seemed
that surely the slender line must snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s like landing a great trout,&rdquo; the
girl told herself.</p>
<p>And now, just as it seemed the line must
break, the rush subsided. Hauling away with
a will they at last gave forth an exultant
shout. Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s hand gripped the
end of the stout rawhide rope that now
spanned the flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have won, child! We have won!&rdquo; he
panted.</p>
<p>But had they? There was much work yet
to be done. A stout line now connected them
with the imperiled ones. How would these
work out their salvation?</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan dragged the line to a stout
tree and fastened it securely there. This
done, his work for the time was over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>It will not seem strange that his eyes wandered
once more to that mysterious cabin
that had, beyond doubt, at one time been
his home. Hardly had he done this than he
leaped to his feet with a wild exclamation on
his lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s leaving! He&mdash;he&mdash;he&rsquo;s running
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed true. Certainly a tall, fur
clad man, driving four huge wolfhounds
hitched to a long sled, left the cabin and was
now racing along a narrow plateau at top
speed. And ever as he ran, he appeared to
urge his dogs to greater effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s leaving!&rdquo; Gordon Duncan said more
quietly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s running away, and he has the
treasure on his sled. You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo; He
turned troubled, questioning eyes on his
granddaughter. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe Timmie&rsquo;d
run away with the green gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the girl without knowing why,
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think he would. He probably
does not know you are Gordon Duncan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless it is the years. Man&rsquo;s mind is
queer,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan. &ldquo;God knew
best when he said, &lsquo;It is not well for man to
dwell alone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed suddenly.
She pointed across the flood.</p>
<p>A strange procession was taking off from
the distant shore. Three dog teams drawing
three loaded sleds, lashed one before the
other, went fearlessly into the flood. Clinging
to the sleds were ten or more human
beings, men, women and children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; exclaimed Gordon Duncan. &ldquo;They
will win yet. They can&rsquo;t swim. No matter.
Their dogs can. They will cling to the sleds.
The rawhide line will save them from the
terrible flood and land them safely on this
shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come on!&rdquo; the girl shouted. &ldquo;We
must be downstream to help them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sped downstream, closely followed by
her sturdy grandfather whose eyes ever and
anon looked longingly away to the spot where
the team of great gray dogs was fast
disappearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>As for Faye, her thoughts were all for the
little brown people who had put so boldly out
into the racing white waters with only a slender
cord to save them from certain destruction.</p>
<p>As the teams and sleds with their clinging
human freight were caught by the flood, they
swung squarely about, facing upstream. It
was then that the little brown huskies proved
themselves true heroes. Beaten back, carried
off their feet, buffeted at, half drowned by the
racing torrent, these dogs kept their small
feet going at a feverish rate.</p>
<p>Had it not been for these many pairs of
little brown feet, each doing its bit, there can
be no doubt but that the rawhide rope must
have snapped. As it was, it held and like a
great pendulum, dogs, sleds, men and cord
swung slowly, surely across the racing peril.</p>
<p>Faye&rsquo;s heart stood still as, pausing at the
point where they must arrive, if indeed they
were to arrive at all, she caught the slow
sweep that was bearing them on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Would they make it? Could they? Would
the little brown beasts give up in despair?
Would the rope part?</p>
<p>Now they were a quarter way across, and
now a half. Here at the very heart of the torrent,
they appeared to hang suspended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not move,&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>And yet, yes, yes, they must be moving.
A tree on the opposite bank, hidden ten seconds
before, was visible now.</p>
<p>Of a sudden fresh peril appeared. Beneath
the water was winter ice that had not yet
thawed. Loosing its grip, a broad cake of
this rose suddenly to the surface. Twenty
yards above the drifting band it appeared
about to ram them, to snap their support, to
overturn their sleds and send them to the
bottom.</p>
<p>But again, as if an invisible hand had
reached down to shove them forward, the pendulum
swung faster. The ice, missing them,
raced harmlessly on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>A moment later Faye was lifting a laughing
brown child from his mother&rsquo;s arms, and a
joyous group of nomad people were clambering
up the shelving bank to safety.</p>
<p>Faye&rsquo;s joy knew no bounds. They had
been instrumental, with God&rsquo;s help, in saving
a half score of lives. While Gordon Duncan
shared quietly in her joy, his heart was in
the hills. His eyes followed the trail over
which the four great dogs and their white
bearded master had vanished.</p>
<p>Sensing all this, Faye resolved at once to
enlist their new-found friends in a fresh endeavor
to come up with her Grandfather&rsquo;s
former companion, and so to solve that which
for her had become a great mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first,&rdquo; she told herself, with a fresh
pang of pain throbbing at her heartstrings,
&ldquo;we must try to find some trace of Johnny
Longbow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>The little brown people they had saved
proved to be Indians from the land of Little
Sticks. In their search for food they had been
forced farther and farther north until they
came to the upper reaches of the mighty
Yukon. Having killed three caribou, they had
found their needs supplied for the moment.
This was enough. They had pitched their
tents on the little island. As they rested before
the long journey back to their accustomed
hunting grounds, they had been caught
unawares by the flood.</p>
<p>Always a wandering people, ever grateful
for kindness, they were ready for any undertaking
or adventure. There was still a supply
of caribou meat on their sleds. What next
should be done?</p>
<p>To the one member of their company who
could understand English, Faye explained the
curious circumstances that had brought them
so far north. She told also of the misadventure
that apparently had befallen their traveling
companion.</p>
<p>No sooner was a simple meal of stewed
meat and tea over than the entire company
spread out fan-shape in a search for the lost
boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Four o&rsquo;clock found them returning to camp
one by one with reports of failure. Only one
clue was brought to light. The three men of
the Indian party returned bearing on their
shoulders great pieces of bear meat. This
bear, they explained, had been slain with a
bow and arrow. They produced the arrow
as proof. And they explained further with
many a strange exclamation that the man
who shot the arrow was the most powerful
giant that ever lived. No Eskimo, no
Indian, no white man they had ever known
pulled a bow with such a force and power.
They felt quite sure he must be some strange
spirit being, not human at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Johnny&rsquo;s arrow,&rdquo; said Faye at once.
&ldquo;But he was possessed of no such strength.
Who could have shot the arrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She suggested the aged recluse, but Gordon
Duncan shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a rather frail man. Now he is old.
It is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Here, then, was fresh mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do no more for Johnny Longbow,&rdquo;
said Gordon Duncan. &ldquo;He is in another&rsquo;s
hands. To-morrow we will follow the trail
of my ancient friend. Since this is true it is
well that I tell you something of that which
befell me on this very mountain many years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping upon one of the Indians&rsquo; deerskins,
Faye awaited eagerly the strange story
which she believed was at last to be unfolded.</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan was slow in beginning. The
girl&rsquo;s heart was sore. It is little wonder that
her mind should return to thoughts of her
brave young companion and his tragic disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;God is
cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing full well that she was seeing in
her mind&rsquo;s eye the tumbled heaps of snow,
earth and rock piled up by the avalanche, Gordon
Duncan spoke quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are thinking of God as if he were all
nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is not nature, and nature is not God.
I think there can be no doubt but that God
often works through nature to do His will.
Perhaps no man living knows precisely God&rsquo;s
relation to nature. Of one thing we may rest
assured, whatever God does through nature is
sure to be just and kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hush settled over the mountain and something
whispered to the girl that all would be
well. So, once more in perfect calm, she settled
back to await Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime, in a far away cabin, still
weak from his terrible experience, Johnny
Longbow lay upon a bed of skins and watched
a creature of prodigious strength and surpassing
ugliness boil a pot of broth over a fire in
a crude hearth set up in one corner of the
cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;What
has happened to me? Where are my friends?
What is to become of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To none of these questions did he find a
satisfactory answer, so once more he gave
himself over to thoughts of his strange host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is the being we
have called the great banshee.&rdquo; A thrill
coursed up his spine at the thought. Had
other evidence been lacking, the size and
shape of the man&rsquo;s feet would be proof
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d fit those tracks we have been seeing
to perfection,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>Truth was, the creature&rsquo;s feet were so deformed
and long as to suggest that a second
foreleg which bent forward had taken the
place of a foot.</p>
<p>Long and anxiously Johnny studied this
strange being. That he was human there
could be no question. Was he Eskimo, Indian
or white man? There was something of all
these in him. His skin was the brownish copper
of an Indian. He dressed like an Eskimo.
Yet he was a giant of a man in spite of his
deformity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Were he able to stand erect as other men
do, he would measure six feet six,&rdquo; Johnny
said to himself. &ldquo;Who ever heard of an
Eskimo that size?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he took to studying the man, his
face, his actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems bright enough and that stuff he&rsquo;s
boiling smells good,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Hope he
gives me some. Wonder how he lives? Hunting,
I suppose. But what weapons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if reading his thoughts, the hunchback
stepped to a dark corner and brought forth
two bows.</p>
<p>One Johnny recognized at once as his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;When I am
strong enough to leave this place I won&rsquo;t
starve at once. Shows some intelligence, his
saving my bow for me.&rdquo; His joy in this matter
was destined to be short lived.</p>
<p>But now his eyes fell on the other bow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A back breaker,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Never
saw such a bow. Must take a pull of eighty-five,
perhaps a hundred pounds to shoot it.
Man, Oh, man!&rdquo; His knowledge of the hunchback&rsquo;s
powers was growing. Nor was it lessened
when this strange man nocked an arrow
fully thirty-six inches in length and, with the
greatest ease, drew his bow to send the arrow
crashing into the opposite wall.</p>
<p>The next move sent consternation into the
boy&rsquo;s heart. Seizing Johnny&rsquo;s fifty pound yew
bow, the hunchback picked up a second arrow
of the same length and nocked it for a shot.</p>
<p>Now Johnny used twenty-eight inch arrows.
To bend his bow for a thirty-six inch
arrow was to court disaster. His mouth
opened in a cry of alarm. But too late. The
iron arm of his curious host drew back. For
the fraction of a second the bow stood the
strain, then, just as the arrow sped, there
came a rending crash, and the bow broke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Standing there, dazed, with the two fragments
of the bow still in his hand, the giant
hunchback, as if expecting an explanation to
this startling affair, stared stupidly about him.</p>
<p>Of a sudden, dropping the shattered bow,
he seized his own bow and, pointing at it, began
jabbering in a tongue which Johnny understood
not at all.</p>
<p>What he did understand was that the
hunchback considered his own bow a very
superior affair, and Johnny&rsquo;s little more than
a toy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that puts a long question mark after
the probability of my getting out of this
land,&rdquo; Johnny told himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; he thought a moment
later, &ldquo;how about a little stew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made some motions as of eating. The
hunchback understood. Soon, like friends of
long standing, they were eating out of a single
huge wooden bowl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>There was little enough ceremony about
this meal. With their fingers they took dripping
morsels from the stew and ate them so.
Ptarmigan and rabbit meat with some dried
roots and seeds of native growth had gone
into the stew. Yet Johnny thought he had not
tasted a better one. When only the thick
broth was left, they took turns at tipping up
the bowl and drinking from its rim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious world,&rdquo; Johnny told himself,
&ldquo;a very strange and startling world. I wonder
what is to become of me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he looked about the rude shelter he saw
no signs of a food store. &ldquo;My bow is broken,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Without this queer creature&rsquo;s
aid I shall starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he forgot his troubles in watching
the hunchback. He was beating his breast and
repeating over and over, &ldquo;Omnakok! Omnakok!
Omnakok!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s trying to tell me his name,&rdquo;
the boy thought. At this he pointed at the
hunchback and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Omnakok.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>The face of this queer being expanded in a
crooked grimace which Johnny took to be a
smile. Then, turning about, he took down a
heavy slab of wood. Having grasped a sharp
instrument similar to a carpenter&rsquo;s drawshave,
he began making the shavings fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; thought Johnny, as he
dropped back to his place among the skins in
the corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />GORDON DUNCAN&rsquo;S STORY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It was years back, so many I have fairly
lost track.&rdquo; Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s tone was deep
and vibrant with emotion as he began his
story of a recluse companion and the treasure
of green gold. &ldquo;There had been some discoveries
of gold back of the Beyond among
the hills and I went. I was younger then.
Went alone. That was my way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met with great misfortune. I found no
gold. Food was scarce. I knew little of the
longbow in those days. In making a try for
a mountain goat, I fell over a ledge and broke
a leg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I might have died there like some maimed
wild creature, had it not been for him.&rdquo; His
eyes wandered to the mountain side, to the
lone cabin and the trail that led away and
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a recluse then, but a kindly soul.
He found me, carried me to his cabin and
cared for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was well, he hunted for us both.
It was he who taught me to prize the longbow
and arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In time I grew proficient in the use of
these primitive weapons. Then, like him, I
wandered far in search of food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on one of these hunting trips that
I came upon a strange sort of grotto in the
side of a cliff. There were ashes of a long
burned out campfire near the entrance. My
curiosity was aroused by this. Making a rude
torch of dry willow twigs, I lighted my way
back a hundred feet or more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There on a ledge, half buried in dust, I
found some curious objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Copper,&rsquo; I said at once. &lsquo;Not worth
much. Take some back for souvenirs.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I chose a crudely formed lamp for burning
tallow, and a rudely fashioned bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how heavy they were! I had not seen
such copper before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I carried them to our cabin and set them
upon the hand-hewn table. When Timmie returned,
with half a caribou slung across his
back, he looked at my find with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once he had lifted them he became excited.
Questions came thick and fast. Where
had I found them? Was it far? Were there
many such? How his words flew!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; I asked at last. &lsquo;They are only
copper. There is no want of copper here;
whole boulders of it in the beds of streams.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Copper!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;Copper! That&rsquo;s
not copper. Haven&rsquo;t you lifted them? They&rsquo;re
made of green gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green gold! I thought he was mad. But
he was not.&rdquo; Again Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s eyes
wandered to the hills. &ldquo;He was sane enough.
He&rsquo;d had a course in such things at some University;
worked in a jeweler&rsquo;s place, too.
Seems they mix some copper with gold. The
result is a greenish combination called green
gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there you are.&rdquo; His words became
deeply reminiscent. &ldquo;I had been hunting gold
for months, digging here, panning dirt there,
but when I did find gold I needed neither
pick nor pan. And I didn&rsquo;t know it was gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day we made three trips to that
cave. Each time we brought back all the green
gold we could carry. That cave must have
been a goldsmith shop of some ancient tribe.
Every nook and cranny was crowded with
green gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All we have to do now,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;is to
take this out to civilization. We are rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Civilization?&rsquo; Timmie said, his eyes
dreamy with thoughts of wide open spaces,
&lsquo;Who wants to go back to that?&rsquo; You see he
was a born recluse. &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; he went on,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s the gold mine. We must find that.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, up to that time I hadn&rsquo;t once thought
of the mine from which this gold had been
taken. But from that moment the finding of
that mine became an obsession with both of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought of nothing else until an unusually
heavy snowfall drove all game away
and left us facing starvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted him to come away then.&rdquo; Once
more Gordon Duncan&rsquo;s tone was mellow with
memories. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t come; but told me
to go, to return with fairer weather, and carry
away my share of the treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a hard trek back. I was lost many
times. Then I went snow blind. Before my
sight was gone I drove my knife in the tree,
as you saw it back there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll find that and be able to make my way
back,&rsquo; I told myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never did, until just the other day.
I reached the shelter of civilization more dead
than alive. My sight was a year coming back.
Then all memory of trails was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I saw that knife in the tree did
it all come back to me. And now,&rdquo; he said
sadly, &ldquo;he is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must follow,&rdquo; said the girl. Her voice
was husky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must follow, not for the green
gold, but for him,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned since,&rdquo; said the old man,
after a long silence, &ldquo;that those strange implements,
dishes and ornaments, coming as they
do from the long lost past, are worth many
times their weight in yellow gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this that I would tell him, and that it
is not good for him to live alone; that in the
end disaster must befall him here, just as it
did to the lone moose back there in our native
forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faye found herself greatly impressed by her
grandfather&rsquo;s story. She was as puzzled as he
by the actions of the recluse, and as eager to
follow his trail. Only one thought dampened
her ardor. Every mile that led away from this
mountain seemed to lessen their hopes of ever
seeing Johnny Longbow again. Yet fate is
often very strange.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>She slept well that night, and woke early,
to find herself on tiptoe, filled with a desire to
be away. To their great joy they found their
new found Indian friends eager to join them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their dogs will be of great service in following
the trail,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan as he
hurried through final preparations for what,
they both felt, was to be a long and dangerous
march.</p>
<p>Dangerous indeed it proved in the end.</p>
<p>Dawn found Gordon Duncan and his granddaughter
with two of the Indian men and
their best dog team on the up-bound trail.
The Indian women and children remained behind.
They had a supply of food. Caribou
would soon be trekking northward. The air
would be full of wild fowl, geese, ducks,
swans, cranes. Spring was on the way. They
would not want.</p>
<p>For the first hour and a half of the journey
the native dog-team lagged. They must be
urged forward. But, of a sudden, as they
reached a higher level, they put their noses
to the earth, sniffed two or three times, then
went straight away at a brisk trot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan as a satisfied
smile overspread his wrinkled face. &ldquo;They
have found Timmie&rsquo;s trail.&rdquo; He always spoke
of the recluse as Timmie, the only name he
had known him by. &ldquo;Now they will not pause
nor lag until they have come up with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All day they followed the team. Spring
surely was coming. They saw it in little rushing
streams. They smelled it in the moisture
that rose from the rocky ledges. They heard
it in the honking of the first flock of wild
geese.</p>
<p>But the signs of spring only saddened Faye
Duncan. &ldquo;Spring means life,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;renewed life. And poor Johnny Longbow
who came with us so far, who in such an unselfish
way gave up his own plans to aid
Grandfather in the realization of his life&rsquo;s
dearest dream, lies beneath the eternal
snows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>But did he? She could not be sure. She
dared hope, for was not his arrow found
piercing the carcass of that monstrous bear?
If his arrow had escaped had not he? Who
could have shot that arrow?</p>
<p>To this question she found no answer. Of
one thing she was certain&mdash;if Johnny Longbow
were free to come to them he would be
at her side. Her heart swelled with undefinable
emotion at the thought.</p>
<p>Still they traveled on. Over a ledge, down
a ravine, across a plateau, the trail led.</p>
<p>At times they caught glimpses of the river,
a bright blue ribbon, far below.</p>
<p>In places the river was white. This meant
that ice had risen to the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon go out, that one ice,&rdquo; said the Indian
who spoke English. &ldquo;Then, whooee! Big
splash, big rush, plenty noise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faye found herself hoping that they might
be within sight of the river when the breakup
came. That was one of Nature&rsquo;s dramas
she had long desired to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Just at sunset the dog team plunged down
a steep embankment and piled up, sled and
all, forty feet below.</p>
<p>From that time until dark they went down.
Down, down, down the trail ran until, as
camping time came, they were surprised to
find themselves in a narrow valley on a level
with the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he be mad enough to take to the
river?&rdquo; Gordon Duncan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; Faye answered.</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan shook his head.</p>
<p>As for the Indians, they looked from Gordon
Duncan to the girl, then back to Duncan
again. Whatever thoughts passed through
their primitive minds remained unexpressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />ADRIFT IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>The ways of the savage and the highly civilized
man are vastly different. One is tempted
to believe at times that the savage has the
better end of the bargain. Civilized man,
from the time he enters school at six or seven,
until he is able to work no longer because of
old age, rises at a certain time each morning,
goes at a stated hour to an appointed place,
stays a specified number of hours for study or
work, then returns to his home. This program
is seldom varied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>The savage has no program. He rises one
morning, comes upon the track of game, begins
a hunt that may lead him far and consume
two days and a night. The game at last
run down and captured, he eats, then lies
down to sleep while the sun goes round the
earth and returns to shine again. Waking,
he eats again. Then finding that some part
of his hunting tog requires attention, he consumes
unlimited hours on the task.</p>
<p>It was so with Omnakok, the hunchback.
Johnny, lying propped up among the deer
skins, watched him shaving away at the slab
of tough wood for two hours before he realized
what he was about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s making a bow,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;a
bow, that&rsquo;s it. Wonder what sort of wood
it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question he could find no answer.
Many strange woods were found here. Besides,
it is known that trade between the
strange northern tribes extends over thousands
of miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May have come from Russia or Greenland,&rdquo;
he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>When his bumps and bruises began to
make themselves felt and his eyes grew heavy
he dropped back among the deer skins and,
entrusting himself to the One who notes the
sparrow&rsquo;s fall, passed into the land of dreams.</p>
<p>When he awoke, several hours later, the
bow was fully fashioned but still the hunchback
stood bending over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s backing it with some tissue,&rdquo; the
boy told himself. &ldquo;I know. It&rsquo;s reindeer
sinew. I&rsquo;ve heard of that. A bow so backed
will never crack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a thought struck him all of a heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s making that bow for me!&rdquo; His
heart gave a great leap. Perhaps no boy in
all the world ever felt such real joy over
prospects of a new bow.</p>
<p>That it was intended for him he could not
doubt for, though made on the same lines and
in the identical manner of Omnakok&rsquo;s own,
it was much lighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds, perhaps sixty,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;How well he has judged my strength.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>Sitting up, he felt his bumps. &ldquo;Not so bad.
Guess I could walk.&rdquo; He stood up, took a
few steps, made a wry face, rubbed his legs,
took a few more steps, then gave vent to a
low laugh. He was getting fit; be able to
travel soon.</p>
<p>Having placed the damp sinew, well mixed
with fish glue, at the back of the bow, Omnakok
placed the bow before the fire, then
dropping into a corner, with legs crossed and
long arms hanging down, he fell asleep.</p>
<p>On tiptoe Johnny wandered from corner to
corner of the cabin. He had been right. There
was no food. The hunchback had shared his
last meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some old sport,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Not so bad
for a savage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he wakes,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;my new
bow will be dry. Then we will go for a hunt.
Wonder what the game will be like?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>Had he known he surely must have shuddered.
Had he known what was happening
to his good pal Faye Duncan, he must have
rushed from the cabin in a mad desire to reach
her side and bring her aid. Knowing none
of these things, he replenished the fire, then
sat down patiently to wait the next move
on the strange checkerboard of life.</p>
<p class="tb">Faye Duncan and her grandfather had
joined the Indians in a meal of stewed bear
meat. Gordon Duncan had taken his place
by the fire for his evening nap, when Tico,
who had been sleeping with nose on paws,
suddenly rose to sniff the air, then to go away
into the night.</p>
<p>Her fear of the unknown overcome by curiosity,
the girl followed him. They had not
gone a hundred paces before they came to a
trail in the snow. Many hours old, even distorted
as they were by the melting of the
snow, the footprints were unmistakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the great banshee!&rdquo; the girl whispered
under her breath.</p>
<p>As for the dog, he lifted up his voice in a
howl which was an unmistakable plaint for
a lost friend. Little wonder. The trail had
been made by the hunchback as he had carried
Johnny to his cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Having completed his dirge of the night,
Tico, nose to the snow, went trotting away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on the trail of the great banshee!&rdquo;
The girl gripped her breast to still her heart&rsquo;s
wild beating. &ldquo;Sha&mdash;shall I follow? Dare I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered her own question by again
taking up the trail.</p>
<p>A quarter mile farther on, she came to that
which made her start and stare. A little to
one side of the trail, a dark spot stood out
against the whiteness of the earth&rsquo;s snow
blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a mitten,&rdquo; she said, picking it up. &ldquo;It,
why it&mdash;&rdquo; again she strove in vain to still her
heart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Johnny&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can say what wild thoughts surged
through her breast as she stood there in the
snow beneath the starry heavens, alone in a
vast hostile wilderness?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>Whatever they may have been, they at last
urged her on at redoubled speed. So, half
walking, half running, she came at last to the
brink of the river. And there catastrophe
befell her.</p>
<p>At this point on his long journey the
hunchback had descended a sloping bank of
snow to travel for a time upon the river&rsquo;s ice
which was still frozen to the bank. Since his
passing, the ice had broken away. Many
yards of his trail had gone floating downstream.</p>
<p>Knowing nothing of this, the girl tried in
vain to discover the way he had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t have taken to the river,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;Still, there may have been a
boat. There&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In leaning over the bank for a better look,
she loosened the undermined mass of snow
and together they plunged into the racing
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end,&rdquo; she told herself in despair
as she felt the sting of icy water. &ldquo;No one
can live in such a torrent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>But what was this? Something touched
her cheek. It was Tico. Seeing his mistress
adrift, he had plunged boldly in, determined
to live or die with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Tico!&rdquo; Her voice choked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
die fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she put forth all her strength in
an effort to regain the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only a steep bank of snow. No one could
scale it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that thought, hoping against hope
that something might come her way, a log,
a snag, an overhanging tree, she gave herself
over to drifting and quiet strokes that kept
her afloat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />THE BATTLE OF THE BEARS</h2>
<p>Much sooner than Johnny expected, the
hunchback awoke. Perhaps the pangs of
hunger were making themselves felt. Be that
as it may, the night was not half gone when,
each armed with a stout bow and a quiver
of arrows, they stole out into the vivid moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night hunting,&rdquo; Johnny thought. &ldquo;Wonder
what sort of game will be afoot at such
an hour? Have to be large. Can&rsquo;t see well
enough for snowshoe rabbit or ptarmigan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>He was soon enough to know.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>As Faye drifted rapidly downstream, now
threatened by floating fragments of ice, and
now caught and whirled around by mad
swirls of racing water, she expected every
moment to reach the end of life. So long,
however, as the faithful Tico swam at her
side she could not give up hope. So, with
the moon painting a mocking golden path to
shore and all the starry reflections dancing
about her, she drifted on.</p>
<p>But what was this? Something cut her
face. Another. This time came a stinging
blow. Putting up a hand to protect herself,
she grasped something and held on for a
second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willows,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Overhanging
willows. There&rsquo;s a chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again her hand went up. At once it was
struck a glancing blow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Oo!&rdquo; The pain in her wrist for the
moment was intense, yet she persevered. The
next attempt was better. Arrested in her
mad flight, she swung round and hung there
for a second. Once more her hold was broken.
Not however until her other hand had gone
up. Before the current had gotten her under
way, she had gripped a stouter, stiffer branch.
With a supreme effort she threw herself half
out of the water to grasp the branch with her
free hand.</p>
<p>The branch was strong. It held her half
free from the water. Another struggle and
she was astride the branch. At once the
branch was submerged. But riding so, she
was able to look about her and to catch a
few fleeting thoughts as to how the affair
would end.</p>
<p>The branch, she discovered, had swung in
quite close to shore. There was a rim of ice
before her, but by working her way down
the branch she could reach a position close
to other and stronger branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get hold of those and swing up,&rdquo; she
said aloud.</p>
<p>To her surprise she caught an answering
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tico!&rdquo; she called as she caught the dog&rsquo;s
encouraging woof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>By the moonlight she made out his form,
dancing on the shore. How had he made it?
She was astonished. But leave it to a dog!</p>
<p>Ten minutes of heart-breaking struggle and
her hands gripped a stronger branch. Even
this dipped low, leaving her only abreast of
the ridge of ice. With one hand she gripped
the slippery surface. For a second she held
on, then all but plunged head foremost into
the tide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my chance.
My strength is leaving me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she threw herself forward. This
time as she felt herself slipping back she
was seized by the collar of her stout mackinaw
and pulled like a rag doll, up, up, up
until she lay flat on the ice, completely exhausted,
but safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Tico!&rdquo; she breathed faintly.
&ldquo;Good Tico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog licked her cold cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>When strength returned, she crept forward
until she found herself on a bank of soft
snow. There she stood up and looked about
her. Matters did not seem much improved.
She was on a narrow island in the midst of
the river. The night was cold. It had been
thawing during the day. Now it was freezing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got&mdash;got to get these things off.&rdquo; Her
teeth were chattering.</p>
<p>Struggling with her sodden garments, she
got them off one by one and, after wringing
them out, hung them on the willows. At last,
quite undressed, she danced about and beat
off the dampness that still clung to her. Such
garments as could be managed under the condition
she drew on again.</p>
<p>As her hand touched the pocket of her
mackinaw she felt something hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matches,&rdquo; she laughed in spite of her
despair. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a little wooden box of sulphur
matches such as are used in the North. They
had been wrapped in oiled cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be a chance,&rdquo; she told Tico solemnly.
&ldquo;Nothing like hoping.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>After drying her hands on some dead willow
leaves that still clung to the branches,
she carefully unwrapped the little box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems dry.&rdquo; Her heart beat faster.</p>
<p>With elaborate care she gathered willow
leaves and small dry twigs, then laid on
larger branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it works, Tico! If it only does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first tiny match turned blue, sent up
sulphurous fumes and went out. The second
did the same. Hope was ebbing when the
blue of the third match turned to red and
the dry leaves were kindled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoops! Whoopee!&rdquo; the girl shouted,
dancing up and down. &ldquo;We win! We win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they did. Fifteen minutes later a roaring
flame was mounting toward the sky. Dry
leaves and green willows make a hot fire.</p>
<p>Before this fire, turning round and round
like a top, was the girl, while on willow
branches, close as she dared have them, were
her steaming garments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p class="tb">Johnny Longbow saw the light of that fire
against the sky, but a hill lay between him
and the river. He believed the reflection to
be a display of Northern Lights.</p>
<p>They were hunting, he and the hunchback,
when he saw that light. A moment after he
saw it the hunchback showed him that which
set his blood racing and drove all thoughts
of the light out of his head.</p>
<p>It was strange, this hunting in the moonlight&mdash;strange
and a bit uncanny. From over
the silver crested hills, the moon shone upon
them. Shadows black as ink were all about
them. Every little depression in the snow
seemed a deep well of mystery. Beneath
their feet the snow, softened as it had been
by the day&rsquo;s thaw, gave forth not the slightest
sound.</p>
<p>So, with bows unstrung and quivers swinging
at their sides, they advanced upon a low
hill. Mounting this, they dropped down upon
the other side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>They were half way down the slope when
the hunchback, stopping dead in his tracks,
braced his bow and nocked an arrow. He
stood there, a grotesque statue in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he seen?&rdquo; the boy asked himself.
Then, without knowing the reason for
it, he put the lower end of his bow against
his instep and bent it. After that he selected
a broadhead from his quiver. Still he saw
nothing, heard nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;Strange and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts broke short off. Down in the
center of the valley, not fifty yards before
them where the shadow of the hill plunged
all in midnight blackness, something had
stirred. After that had come a grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a pig,&rdquo; Johnny thought. &ldquo;But of
course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again his thoughts broke off. A head had
risen above the shadow line, a great grizzly
head with a red, lolling tongue. This was no
pig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>One instant it was there, the next it was
gone. But the boy had seen enough to set
his heart racing. Squatting down with one
knee on the snow, he swung his bow into
place and waited.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait. The creature, a
great northern grizzly bear, was moving now.
She was coming out of the shadows. Johnny&rsquo;s
breath came hard as he saw the size of her.
His heart stopped beating altogether when
he realized that she was leading two half
grown cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bows and arrows,&rdquo; he thought. Never
had they seemed such frail weapons as now,
yet he was prepared to do his best.</p>
<p>As these thoughts passed through his mind,
the three bears moved out into the field of
light.</p>
<p>Johnny felt a light pressure on his arm.
He understood. They were to shoot. Once
more his heart raced. Yet his hand was
steady as he drew his bow. By instinct he
seemed to understand that he was to shoot
at the larger of the two cubs. The hunchback
would aim at the great beast&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s whole body
stiffened. His arrow flew, and with it another.</p>
<p>In an instant there was tumult in the bears&rsquo;
camp. Having neither seen nor smelled their
enemies, both the cubs and the old one
blamed his companion for the pain that had
leaped upon them from the dark. At once
they fell upon one another. Such growling
and roaring, such cuffing and scratching
Johnny had not known in his life.</p>
<p>It was all so ludicrous that he wanted to
roll in the snow with laughter. Yet there
was a more serious side. Neither of the bears
had received a mortal wound. Tumbling
about as they were now, there was little
chance for a good shot. How long would it
be before they discovered their mistake and
came charging up the hill? Nocking a second
arrow, he awaited the next turn of events.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>From her island fastness Faye Duncan
heard the noise of battle, and shuddered.
Growling savagely, the dog marched back
and forth in the snow. But neither girl nor
dog knew what it was all about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>One thought was uppermost in the girl&rsquo;s
mind. She must get off the island and rejoin
her companions. But how was this to be
done? She had saved her Indian friends
from a similar predicament, but now there
was no yarn to bring a rawhide rope to her.
Besides, the rope was now far back in the
camp of women and children.</p>
<p>A little ice was passing. Mere fragments,
these would not support her weight. She was
interested to note, however, that swinging
round a sharp bend, the current brought these
fragments very near the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only they were large enough to support
my weight!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>But the fire was burning low. The night
chill was creeping in. Her clothing was not
yet dry.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;More wood,&rdquo; she thought as she twisted
away at a tough willow branch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>In the meantime the battle of bears was
slowing down. Seeing an opening, the hunchback
sent a second arrow crashing into the
ribs of the old grizzly. Was it this arrow
that suggested a foe from without? As the
bear&rsquo;s great head turned about, the bristle
hair on her neck and shoulders began to rise.</p>
<p>Johnny saw it as in a dream. He woke
from the dream with a start when the grizzly,
at a pace not exceeded by the fastest horse,
charged straight up the hill.</p>
<p>For this the hunchback was prepared. He
had lain five of his best arrows, tipped with
points of volcanic glass, side by side in the
snow. Now, as if shot from some new form
of repeating blowgun, one by one these
arrows went crashing into the charging
monster.</p>
<p>As for Johnny, his usually alert mind
seemed frozen. Only after the hunchback&rsquo;s
third arrow had found its mark with the
beast still plowing forward did he get into
action. Then, realizing that his arrow, a
good broadhead with razor edge, was in place,
he wondered where to aim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>There was no time to be lost. Instinctively
he picked the beast&rsquo;s lolling red mouth.
Twang! The arrow sped. The next instant,
to his vast astonishment, he saw the beast
rear high, utter one wild roar and drop backward
dead.</p>
<p>Three shots from the hunchback&rsquo;s bow
silenced the two younger bears forever. Then
it was time for investigation. The arrow
that Johnny shot had entered the bear&rsquo;s
mouth, had pierced the thin bone at the top
and had entered the brain.</p>
<p>As the hunchback realized this, he turned
and looked at Johnny. A smile overspread
his face and he patted the boy clumsily on
the shoulder.</p>
<p>After that, leaving the old bear where she
lay, he partially skinned one of the cubs and,
after slinging a good hundred pounds of meat
across his shoulder, beckoned the boy to
follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />THE HUNCHBACK LEADS ON</h2>
<p>Someone else saw the light of Faye&rsquo;s fire
against the sky. Sitting crosslegged on their
deerskins, the two Indians squinted at it for
a time in stolid silence. After that a few
guttural exclamations passed between them.
Then, having drawn their moccasins on, they
hurried away down the river, leaving Gordon
Duncan asleep by the fire.</p>
<p>What words had they spoken? Had they
judged the girl too long gone from camp?
Did they fear for her safety? Or did they
suspect a hostile encampment?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>Whatever it may have been, they traveled
rapidly. Passing through a clump of pine
trees they chose two hard knots, then hurried
on. By the time they came within sight
of the island Faye&rsquo;s clothes were dry. She
had donned them again, and might be seen
moving about replenishing the fire. Accustomed
as they were to accurate observation
of living things at a distance, the Indians
had no trouble in recognizing her.</p>
<p>At once they lighted their torches. The
girl saw, and her heart leaped with joy. Her
plight had been discovered. Here was hope.</p>
<p>Noting that the ice fragments that drifted
by were growing larger, she endeavored to
calculate the possibility of riding one to
safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; she told Tico. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Though Johnny Longbow had seen the
light of his good friend&rsquo;s fire, and she in turn
had heard the noise of his battle with the
bears, morning was destined to find them
once more far apart. To Johnny&rsquo;s great surprise
the hunchback, after replenishing their
larder, did not lead the way back to the cabin
where they had last slept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>Instead he struck away across the hills.
When they had traveled for the greater part
of an hour and had come to a barren and
rocky dry ravine, he piled a heap of large
stones in the form of a rude oven. Beneath
this he kindled a fire and roasted meat.</p>
<p>After giving Johnny a liberal supply of
bear meat and devouring great quantities
himself, he again took up his burden and led
away over other hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this all to end?&rdquo; Johnny asked
himself. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t much matter where we
go. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest notion which
direction would lead me to my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the hunchback was pleased with him
was shown by his actions as they paused now
and then to rest. At such times he went
through the motions of a charging bear.
Opening his mouth wide he acted a pantomime
of receiving a mortal wound in the
mouth, and falling backward dead. These
actions were followed by loud laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Johnny told himself, &ldquo;probably
indicates approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not the least bit displeased that
the hunchback held a friendly feeling for him;
yet he was led to wonder many times and
how long he was to wander and how the
affair was to end.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Faye&rsquo;s escape from her island was less
dramatic than that of the Indians she had
saved. As she waited, a surprisingly large
cake of ice drifted by. Seizing the opportunity,
she sprang once more into the chilling
waters, swam a few strokes, clambered
aboard, drifted close to shore, was caught
and dragged to land by the husky natives.
Then, followed by the dripping Tico, she
raced away to camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>For a second time that night her garments
were hung by a fire to dry. This time, however,
she did not dance away the chill, but
creeping deep down among the blankets and
deerskins, fell asleep to dream of towering
icebergs and racing floods.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>As he tramped on and on, mile after mile
over low ridges, down narrow valleys,
through sparse growth of fir and tangled
masses of willows, following his strange guide
through the night, Johnny wondered over
and over what their destination might be.</p>
<p>More than this, his mind was filled with
wild speculations regarding the future. What
were the plans that revolved in the mind of
this hunchback? Had he any plans? His
attitude amused Johnny. Of course he was
only a boy, but in the wilds where he so often
takes a man&rsquo;s part a boy soon enough gets
to rate himself as a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to think of me as a child,&rdquo; he
told himself after the strange being had finished
patting him on the head. &ldquo;No, not
quite that either; more like a cub. That&rsquo;s it,
a bear cub.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>In a park where bears were protected and
tame, Johnny had often amused himself by
watching the actions of mother bears and
their cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems a great hunter of bears,&rdquo; Johnny
told himself. &ldquo;No doubt, living as he does in
such isolation, he knows more about bears
than human beings. But am I to be his cub
weeks on end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pictured himself living in the wilderness
with this curious wanderer, dressing in skins,
hunting with bow and arrow, fishing with
crude nets, living the life of a savage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunchback heard. Turning about, he
leered at him in a strange fashion. Then they
tramped on.</p>
<p>Just as dawn was breaking they came upon
a thick growth of fir trees crowning the crest
of a hill. At the very center of this they
found a cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>This cabin was much more perfectly built
than the other. The stones for its chimney
were cut in squares. The logs had been hewn
off on two sides. And beside the fireplace
hung two heavy iron skillets and three stew-pans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he build it, or appropriate it after some
trapper or prospector had left it?&rdquo; the boy
asked himself.</p>
<p>Too weary for thought, he went about the
business of frying bear steak over the fire
kindled by his companion. After eating, he
buried himself in a great heap of furs and
lost himself in the land of dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />THREE BEAR SKINS</h2>
<p>Early next morning, before Gordon Duncan
was astir, and while the girl still slept the
sleep of exhaustion, the Indians crept from
beneath their caribou skins and journeyed
forth in quest of food.</p>
<p>Within the hour they returned. And such
a load as they carried on their backs! Three
bear skins and two hundred pounds of meat
they cast down upon the ground. Then kicking
off the hungry dogs, they cut away broad
slices to throw them in the midst of the fighting
pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three bears!&rdquo; said Faye when she saw
them. &ldquo;How can they have killed them so
soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not kill,&rdquo; said the Indian who understood
English. &ldquo;Dead, that one, two, three bear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! Then there is someone about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who killed them?&rdquo; She was examining
one of the skins. The marks she found
there had not been made by bullets, but by
arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White man no save,&rdquo; said the Indian,
shaking his head. &ldquo;That one Indian,&rdquo; nodding
to his companion, &ldquo;how you say it? Him
one doctor, one shamin. Plenty spirits help
him. Spirit eagle, spirit white fox, spirit old
man, long time dead, never shoot rifle, always
bow and arrow, that one help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this one morning he say, that one (another
nod toward his companion), that one
say, &lsquo;Spirit of old man, kill bear for my dinner.
Kill one, two, three bear. Kill him.&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s all. See old man&rsquo;s tracks, mine. So
big!&rdquo; He stretched out his arms at full length.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is trying to tell you,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan,
&ldquo;that his companion has a familiar spirit;
that he is in league with the ghost of an old
man and that the ghost, at his request, has
killed three bears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faye shook her head. She did not believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I.&rdquo; Her grandfather smiled.
&ldquo;But we have the meat. It is enough. Now
we may resume our journey in search of Timmie
and the green gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Faye been alone she most certainly
would have visited the valley of dead bears.
Had she done so, she must surely have recognized
at once the footprints of her lost pal
and the &ldquo;great banshee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, looking at the drawn face of her aged
sire and realizing what long miles must still
lie before him, she permitted him to have his
way without a word.</p>
<p>All day the dogs followed the faint trail
left by the fleeing Timmie and his wolfhounds.
That night they camped beneath a sheltering
cliff that lay at the foot of a heavily timbered
hill. At the crest of that hill was a cabin, and
in that cabin Johnny Longbow slept. Had a
shot been fired by one of the Indians he must
have heard it. No shot was fired. There was
food in abundance. Besides, there was nothing
to kill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>So, early next morning, they prepared again
for the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder why they carry those raw skins
along,&rdquo; Faye said to Gordon Duncan as the
natives lashed the three bear pelts to their
sled. &ldquo;They weigh as much as our whole kit.
And what possible good can they be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faye,&rdquo; the old man rumbled, &ldquo;to a native
of this land a pelt of any kind is a precious
thing. All year round he dresses in skins,
always he sleeps beneath them. His home in
summer is built of them, and in winter they
form the floor mat which protects his feet
from the cold earth. His dog harness is made
of skins, his sled lashed together with them.
To these Indians a pelt is a thing of great
value. To cast it away is to offend the spirit
of the dead bear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>All that he said was true enough. Too soon
he was to discover the real reason these sturdy
little brown men were willing to put their
own shoulders to the harness that the skins
might remain upon the sled.</p>
<p>As they broke camp that day, Faye found
herself wondering about many things. Would
they come up with Timmie? Did he carry on
his sled the strange collection of green gold
antiques? Was he truly attempting to run
away with the gold? If so, why? And what
of Johnny, her good pal of the long trail?
They had experienced many adventures together.
Would their trails ever cross again?
She could not quite believe him dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adventures,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;How little enjoyment
one gets from an adventure when he
has no one to share it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adventure came soon enough that day. But
first they arrived at that which appeared to
be an impasse in their journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>The trail that morning led for three miles
across a barren tundra. There it lost itself in
a tangled wilderness of trees and bushes. The
trusty dogs did not so much as falter. Their
senses were sure; their aim true.</p>
<p>But what was this? After an hour of travel
through the silent forest they came to an
abrupt halt. Before them lay a tangled mass
of freshly cut boughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made camp here last night,&rdquo; said Faye
as her heart gave a great leap. &ldquo;Per&mdash;perhaps
he is still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly she hoped this might be true.
The trail had been long, very, very long, and
she was weary. It was not the weariness that
comes from one day of strenuous toil, but the
bone weariness of the long, long trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Gordon Duncan said a moment
later. &ldquo;Gone down the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not down the river!&rdquo; Faye passed
round the pile of brush, to drop weakly to
earth as she read unmistakable signs of a raft
built and pushed off from the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; she said, her eyes reflecting the
tragedy of her heart, &ldquo;he was here working
while we slept! And now he is gone; gone
forever. And we have come all this way but
to know defeat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must follow,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The break-up will come. We will perish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must trust God, and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indians answered this question. Producing
their bear skins they began cutting
willows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We make skin boat,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Tie wood
together so; stretch skin so; sew it this way;
not leak. Very good boat. Ride water. Ice
not break. Very strong. Very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan. &ldquo;God
sent you to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh-eh, the Great Spirit,&rdquo; said the Indian.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, in a boat that might
have been made by some primitive man three
thousand years before, they glided from the
shore and away through the water that ran
above the surface of six foot ice which, soon
enough, would rise and go booming and
crowding and grinding toward the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>Faye&rsquo;s heart missed a beat as she took her
place in the prow. They were facing grave
dangers. Would this be her last ride?</p>
<p>And yet it was to be a race, a race between
a raft and a skin boat on a turbulent river.
Races are always thrilling. Soon her nerves
were all a-tingle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />LEFT BEHIND</h2>
<p>That the hunchback was a great sleeper
Johnny was soon enough to know. After their
long journey he slept far into the day. Even
after he awoke he appeared to be in a dull
stupor, produced, Johnny supposed, by eating
great quantities of bear meat.</p>
<p>Grateful as he was for the rest, the boy
found himself growing restless. Longing to
know more about his strange surroundings
and especially eager to discover whether or
not he was in a region visited at times by
white men, he slipped out of the cabin, then
went slipping and sliding down the steep hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>He discovered little enough. In the scrub
forest he found no mark of the white man&rsquo;s
axe. Had he chanced to go down the other
slope he would have seen plenty, as you well
know. For two days, the while preparing his
raft, the aged recluse had camped at the far
end of that slope.</p>
<p>After a two-hour ramble, Johnny returned
to the cabin. In one pocket was a double handful
of last year&rsquo;s blueberries. In one hand he
carried two grouse which had fallen before
his bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;will make a more
appetizing meal than greasy bear meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunchback sat just as he had left him,
doubled up in the corner, asleep or at least
dozing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hibernates like a bear,&rdquo; the boy told
himself in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could leave him,&rdquo; he thought later as he
plucked the feathers from his two birds.
&ldquo;Strike right away into the wilderness, be
gone so far and so fast that he&rsquo;d never find
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>There was a thought for you. But did he
want to leave? Crude and repulsive as the
creature was, he had beyond doubt saved his
life. Then, too, he knew the ways of the country,
was used to procuring food in it. With no
companion one might easily meet up with
starvation on the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;if he keeps this
up, at least I will get out and see more of the
country. May find a way out. To-morrow I
will go toward the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he but known it, at that very moment
Gordon Duncan was lighting his campfire at
the foot of the hill. He did not know it. Since
the scrub forest was dense here, no gleam of
firelight, no whiff of smoke announced to him
the presence of his friends. So once more, in
the midst of rich furs he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Before his strange host was up and about
the boy crept from the cabin to go tramping
away through the silent forest. The rise on
which the cabin stood was more a ridge than
it was a hill. It ran for miles along the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>The slope on the river side was steep and
rocky. In places there were sheer precipices
of forty or fifty feet. To avoid a dangerous
fall, he continued along the crest of the ridge.</p>
<p>Having caught a gleam of water far below,
he realized that he was following down the
stream. At last, wearying of continual attempts
to find a way down, hoping to discover
a pass, he climbed a steep rocky pinnacle that
gave him an unobstructed view of the river.</p>
<p>There he saw that which brought an exclamation
to his lips and set his heart beating
wildly. A boat had just pushed off from the
bank and was swinging out into mid-channel.
Lacking efficient paddles, the men at prow
and stern were managing the craft with poles.
A curious sort of boat it was, crudely built
and hard to navigate; yet these Indians managed
it well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians,&rdquo; Johnny thought. &ldquo;But the two
in the center of the boat. One&rsquo;s a girl. The
other&rsquo;s too tall. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden, like a revelation it came to
him. The man was Gordon Duncan, the girl
Faye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>With a sudden headlong rush, he was off
the rocky tower and away down the hill. Little
matter now that the way was steep and
rocky. This was a race, a hurdle race for a
precious prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only they stall the boat. If only they
turn back,&rdquo; he panted as, gripping the bough
of a spruce tree, he fairly hurled himself to
the next tree. Down, down, down. Now a
rocky ledge, now a glistening bank of snow,
now a clump of trees, over, under, through he
went until at last, ragged, torn, bleeding, he
reached level land and in time the river&rsquo;s
brink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; he groaned as his eyes swept
the river. Not a moving thing was to be seen
on its surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s as if I dreamed that I
saw them,&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>As if to convince himself that he had not
been dreaming, he followed along the bank to
the spot where the crude bearskin boat had
pushed off. There he found unmistakable
signs; footprints told who had been there but
an hour before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left behind!&rdquo; He buried his face in his
hands.</p>
<p>At that instant a sound from behind him
caused him to start. Turning quickly about,
he found himself staring into the beady eyes
of the hunchback.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />ADVENTURE IN PANTOMIME</h2>
<p>On a river ever broadening as it made its
way toward the far distant sea, rode a crude
skin canoe. In the canoe rode Gordon Duncan,
his granddaughter Faye and the two Indians.
They had not left that canoe since they
entered it, and that had been sixteen hours
back.</p>
<p>To the white man and the girl this wild
journey had been a constant strain; to the
Indians it was but the day&rsquo;s work. Many
times before for twenty, thirty hours they had
ridden thus without sleeping.</p>
<p>To land now was impossible; to turn back
was out of the question. Besides, who would
turn back? Had they not, but a quarter of an
hour ago, caught a glimpse of that which they
sought?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>They had rounded a rocky ledge where the
river ran between low hills and had come upon
a long, straight stretch of water. At the end
of that stretch a dark object specked the
water.</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan had lifted the glass once
to his eyes and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Timmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raft and the man had disappeared at
once beyond a bend in the river; yet there
was now ground for hope. And here they
were still driving their boat forward, still
hoping that before disaster befell that aged
recluse and his crazy craft, they might overtake
him and save him from a terrible death.
For, should they fail, disaster from crowding
ice, rushing rapids and the mad spring upheaval
must surely overtake him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he once saved my life,&rdquo; said Gordon
Duncan. &ldquo;We may have been hasty, followed
him too far. It&rsquo;s too late to think of that now.
We can only follow on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>The journey thus far had been exciting,
but quite safe. There was a wild charm about
it all, the racing water, the black, brown and
green of fleeting landscape, the occasional
flocks of wild ducks that shot by them, and
the smell of spring everywhere charmed the
young Scotch girl.</p>
<p>Yet it was dangerous. They might meet
disaster at any turn. Her grandfather had
told Faye this, and she believed it. The water
they passed over at first had seemed white.
That was because the winter ice still lay still
beneath the surface water that had rushed
down from hills and mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it should rise beneath us!&rdquo; she said with
a shudder.</p>
<p>When, after a half hour of dreamy half-sleeping,
she looked at the water, it was black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ice has gone out down here,&rdquo; her grandfather
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we are safe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it. The ice before us may jam at
any point. It will then pile mountain high. If
there are steep banks as here, we will face
disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not say, &ldquo;Then why not turn
back?&rdquo; She knew the man too well. He had
seen what seemed to him a duty. He could
but go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Johnny Longbow were here!&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Johnny Longbow was surprised and not a
little frightened on seeing the hunchback close
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; he thought as his heart
skipped a beat. &ldquo;He was not so sleepy as I
supposed. He&rsquo;s followed me. Did he believe
me to be running away? If so, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever might be the strange creature&rsquo;s
feelings in the matter, the grin he bestowed
upon Johnny was friendly enough. His actions
during the next few minutes showed
plainer than words that he knew more than
Johnny did about the whole affair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>Selecting a smooth surface of snow, he
scooped out a channel for a distance of twenty
feet. This channel was a foot wide and two
inches deep. Next, having searched out a
bundle of brittle twigs, he began breaking
one up and laying the pieces side by side in
the bottom of the channel. When he had constructed
a rude square some eight inches
across, he selected certain bent and twisted
bits of wood and, with a skill that seemed
extraordinary, created a tiny image of a man
with a paddle in his hand. This he placed well
to the front upon the small platform. Back
of this he built up a miniature sled and four
dogs.</p>
<p>All this was Greek to Johnny. When, however,
with a few clever twists the man had
made a small boat and, after placing four
figures within it, had dropped it in the shallow
channel, it all came to Johnny like a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow channel represents the river,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;The figures in the skin boat
are my friends and the two Indians. But that
before them must be a raft. What of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>He studied over this for some time without
reaching a conclusion. That a raft was passing
on before his friends, and that it carried
a man, a sled and four dogs, this much was
certain. But who was the man?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Might be
anyone, a trapper, a prospector, a lone Indian.
But my comrades have gone ahead. How am I
to overtake them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his eyes as he tried in vain to catch some
glimpse of those who had glided from his
field of vision was a glint of despair.</p>
<p>The hunchback, who during all this time
had been studying his face, did not appear
satisfied.</p>
<p>Selecting larger sticks, he constructed on
the ground a larger raft. With infinite pains
he built up a new wooden man, four dogs and
a sled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>Then, with equal care he began moulding
small models from snow. One was a rude
cooking pot, another a flat pan, a third a
prehistoric lamp. Other figures were added.
When all these were done, he piled them on
the newly made raft, and atop them all, a disc
of metal taken from a pocket of his skin
trousers.</p>
<p>Still Johnny did not understand. When he
shook his head, the hunchback seized the
metal affair and pressed it into his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green,&rdquo; he told himself as he turned it
over, &ldquo;Green like copper, but heavy as lead.
What can it be? What&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green gold!&rdquo; he cried excitedly. &ldquo;And now
I understand. It is Timmie and his green gold
they are following. He rides ahead on a raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that he was at last understood, the
hunchback roared with hoarse laughter.</p>
<p>After that, having seized Johnny&rsquo;s hunting
knife, with a few clever strokes he shaped a
miniature canoe. In this he placed two sticks.
After pointing to one, he struck Johnny a
light blow. Then, after touching the other, he
smote his own breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>Dropping the toy canoe in the snow channel,
he moved it along until it was abreast the
skin boat. Then both boats overtook the
raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s plain enough,&rdquo; the boy told himself.
&ldquo;We are to get into a boat and pursue them.
We will overtake my friends. Then together
we will overhaul Timmie and his raft load of
dogs and green gold. Only question is, where&rsquo;s
our boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if understanding the question, the hunchback
laid heavy hands upon him, turned him
half about and marched him down the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI
<br />INTO THE ICE JAMB</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Gordon Duncan, as once more
they caught sight of Timmie&rsquo;s raft. &ldquo;We shall
be up with him soon. Once we are close, when
he sees my face he will know it is I, his friend
Gordon Duncan. We will bring him and his
treasure to the outside world. His last days
shall be happy ones after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, gripping
his arm.</p>
<p>One look, and he started to his feet. The
white-haired man before them appeared to
leap and dance upon the water. Appearances
were deceiving. The raft leaped and danced
over rapids. And mingled with the rapids
were broken fragments and great heaps of
ice. Here the water boiled and foamed, there
it rushed like mad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shall all be drowned!&rdquo; said the girl,
gripping the old man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust God,&rdquo; the man murmured. &ldquo;I only
fear for Timmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, things happened. They
had been coming nearer and nearer to the
clumsy raft when, as they turned a sharp bend
in the river, they saw that the aged recluse
faced disaster. Stretching all the way across
the river was ice piled forty feet high. Jambing,
screeching, rolling and tumbling, it
threatened all life that came near. And there
was the white haired recluse headed straight
for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has only a pole. He can&rsquo;t guide the
thing. He&rsquo;s lost!&rdquo; groaned Gordon Duncan.</p>
<p>He did not know the skill of the man. Poking
at a cake of ice here, fanning the water
with his pole there, jabbing, poling, fighting
his best, the raftsman drove his clumsy craft
toward the western bank. It seemed that he
would make the bank before the gurgling
waters drew him into that maelstrom. Faye
held her breath and hoped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>Now he was thirty feet from the bank, now
twenty, now&mdash;now he rose to his feet as if
for a try at a leap. His four dogs howled dismally.
He looked at them in dismay. That
look was his undoing. An eddy caught his
raft and carried it toward midstream. The
next instant a redoubled pull of current shot
him forward.</p>
<p>Only one hope remained. By the left shore,
crowding thirty feet out over the water, was a
glacier-like snowbank. Solidly joined to the
shore as it was, this bank did not heave and
roll as did the free ice. Only beneath it the
black waters raced. Between the hard packed
snow and the river&rsquo;s surface was a broad dark
line. This was an air space where the snow
had been worn away by higher water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t go under,&rdquo; Gordon Duncan
breathed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be killed. He must jump
for the solid snow. It&rsquo;s his only hope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>The Indians in the skin canoe were battling
the current to bring their canoe ashore. As
for Gordon Duncan and Faye, they had eyes
only for the drama that was being enacted
there before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; murmured Gordon Duncan as a
great dog, leaping far and wide, made the
snow bar in safety. One, two, three, four, the
dogs were away.</p>
<p>And now, now! Faye breathed in little
gasps. The recluse, standing erect, motionless,
prepared to leap. Now he bent low, now
he sprang straight up and away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s safe!&rdquo; breathed Gordon Duncan.</p>
<p>But now. What happened? Did the current
give the raft a sudden turn? Did the old
man&rsquo;s strength suddenly fail? His leap fell
short. He struck the snow, tottered there for
a second; then, as the raft with its load of
precious green gold shot into the darkness
beneath the overhanging snowbar, he tottered
and fell full into the raging flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; exclaimed Gordon Duncan.
&ldquo;Lost! Lost forever!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>The next instant their boat, guided by the
trusty natives, bumped on a shelving bank
and they were quickly drawn up to safety.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as if to veil the catastrophe,
a fog drifting down over all, hid all,
ice, snow and rushing river, from their view.
Ten minutes later a resounding roar told them
that something terrific was happening on the
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ice jamb is broken,&rdquo; Gordon Duncan
said quietly. &ldquo;The current is now free. It
came too late. We have lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Urged on by the impatient hunchback,
Johnny fought his way forward through
tangled willows, over rock piles and down
treacherous slopes of melting snow until of a
sudden, with an involuntary shout of joy, he
came plump against a large dugout turned
upside down upon the ground.</p>
<p>To launch this craft, clumsy as it was, required
but a moment&rsquo;s time. Such was the
magnificent strength of the hunchback.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>And now they had entered the race. With
a paddle twice the size and strength of the
white man&rsquo;s canoe paddle, the hunchback
drove the dugout forward in the rushing
waters at a terrific pace.</p>
<p>It was Johnny who first heard the roar of
the bursting ice jamb. They were nearly two
miles away, but it filled his breast with a wild
terror. That his friends rode the torrent
before him he knew. What had happened to
them? What was about to befall him?</p>
<p>The current was swift. It bore them on
rapidly. When the fog dropped down upon
them he realized that safety lay in seeking out
shelter in some quiet eddy close to the bank.</p>
<p>That this thought was in the hunchback&rsquo;s
mind soon became evident. He began hugging
the shore.</p>
<p>So intent were they upon reaching a place
of safety that they failed to note a picture
framed in fog that for ten seconds flashed
into view, then was lost forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>Without knowing why they did so, both
Faye Duncan and her grandfather stood upon
the bank as they passed. It was Faye&rsquo;s keen
eyes that caught sight of the racing dugout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried, quite beside herself.
&ldquo;Johnny, Johnny Longbow and the great
banshee!&rdquo; She was quite beside herself with
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan.
&ldquo;You must be dreaming. A bad dream. I
see nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did see them!&rdquo; she insisted vehemently.
&ldquo;They passed, they passed in the fog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan, &ldquo;we shall
doubtless see them later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will we? They are riding the flood.
The ice jamb is gone. But there may be
others. And, he is with that terrible creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humanity,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan quietly,
&ldquo;is everywhere very much alike. He is in
God&rsquo;s hands. Beyond doubt the All Seeing
One has provided him a friend in this vast
wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; said the girl more calmly,
a great joy expressed in her tones, &ldquo;he is
alive! He is not dead. Johnny Longbow is
not dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did such a wild dance in the snow that
Gordon Duncan could well have believed they
were home again and all their troubles over.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime Johnny and his strange
pilot had passed on into the fog. They traveled
a good three miles before they came to
the haven of refuge they sought, a quiet eddy
by the bank of the stream.</p>
<p>With a sigh of relief Johnny unbent his
cramped limbs and went ashore.</p>
<p>To his surprise he found the earth soggy
with seeping water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been a flood,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>This was true. The breaking of the ice
jamb had momentarily clogged the stream.
Water had risen rapidly. The bayou had been
flooded. Sudden as it had come, so sudden it
receded. Not, however, until something had
happened. What this was, Johnny was soon
to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>As he climbed the slope in search of a dry
spot, to his vast astonishment, stranded high
and dry, he came upon a crude raft laden
with strange packages bound up in skins.
And clinging to the raft, as if it were still in
motion, was a white haired old man.</p>
<p>Johnny wondered at the packages and the
man, but he did not wonder long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is Timmie, the
recluse. And the packages on the raft!&rdquo; His
heart beat wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first this old man&rsquo;s needs must be
attended to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After disengaging his hands from the raft,
Johnny helped the hunchback carry the old
man up the hill to a dry spot. There they
soon had him stripped of his sodden garments
and wrapped in their own deerskins before a
roaring fire.</p>
<p>There, for the first time, he opened his eyes
and murmured something about &ldquo;Green gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<p>It was four hours later that the boy was
wakened from a short doze by the fire by the
ring of a rifle shot close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone near,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Wonder
who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Hello there!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello yourself,&rdquo; came back from the hills
above.</p>
<p>Three minutes later the boy stood staring
in astonishment at four persons who had just
emerged from the brush, two Indians, a white
man and a girl. There were tears of real joy
in his eyes, for the man and girl were his long
lost friends Gordon Duncan and Faye.</p>
<p class="tb">Their story was quickly told. No longer
daring to trust themselves to the treacherous
waters, the party had pushed forward on foot
in the hope, as had been their good fortune,
though in a manner quite unexpected, of finding
some trace of the aged recluse and his
craft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>As they followed an animal trail a young
caribou had appeared before them. One of the
Indians had shot it. This shot had told Johnny
of their presence.</p>
<p>So now, here they were all together again.
And Timmie was with them. What a joyous
reunion it was! Even Timmie, who recognized
his pal of other days, seemed happy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">[304]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII
<br />GREEN GOLD AT LAST</h2>
<p>The story of the aged recluse, Timmie, was
soon told. After his companion Gordon Duncan
had left him, more than twenty years
before, the caribou had come and a fresh
supply of provisions was at hand. That spring
too, other prospectors had come up the river.
In return for his services as a guide, they had
supplied him with white man&rsquo;s food.</p>
<p>As the years passed, he had given up hope
that Gordon Duncan would return; but even
so, he guarded their secret well.</p>
<p>Ever a lover of nature and her solitary
haunts, he was content to dwell alone at the
foot of the smoking mountains. Every year,
as the winter&rsquo;s snow melted away, as the
honking geese passed above the rivers and a
million flowers bloomed, he had shouldered
pick and pan to begin one more search for
the mine of green gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">[305]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never found it,&rdquo; he whispered as, buried
deep in warm deer skins, he told his story.
&ldquo;But yonder on the raft, just as I was carrying
it, you will find the green gold, every
piece. Every piece. Just as we found it so
many years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it, Gordon Duncan.&rdquo; His whisper
came from deep in his throat. &ldquo;For many
years I have prized and guarded it. Now it
must be entrusted to your hands. I am soon
to pass to that happy land where there are no
spring torrents, no snow, no cold, no smoking
mountains and no night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; said Faye Duncan, pressing his
hand. &ldquo;You are going to find health in the
spring sunshine. We will carry you from this
dreary land to the place where yellow roses
bloom and the air is heavy with the fragrance
of daffodils.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">[306]</div>
<p>Timmie read the distress in her tone. He
smiled and said no more. Yet he knew what
he knew, and was content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you run from us?&rdquo; Gordon
Duncan asked.</p>
<p>A pained, puzzled look came over the face
of the aged recluse. &ldquo;I do not know. I am
growing old. When one is old he becomes
afraid of many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hoard of green gold on Timmie&rsquo;s raft
was indeed a great treasure. Johnny, who had
traveled much and knew the value of such
things coming from a very remote past, reckoned
their value in many thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>One day, two weeks later, having buried
Timmie among the hills he had loved so long,
bidding an affectionate farewell to their Indian
guides and the strange hunchback, the party
of three, Gordon Duncan, Faye and Johnny,
put off from shore in a new dugout which
their friends had made for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">[307]</div>
<p>Three days later, as they drifted down the
silent river which was now quite free from
ice, to their great surprise they caught the
distant drum of an airplane.</p>
<p>Straining their eyes, they saw it at last just
clearing the mountains to the north. Imagine
their surprise when it went out of sight behind
the timber not five miles from where they
were.</p>
<p>When, two hours later, on rounding a bend
in the river, they sighted the camp of more
than a hundred white men, their joy knew no
bounds.</p>
<p>Soon enough they were told of a fresh gold
strike on these upper reaches of the river.
The passenger airplane which was bringing
men into the country was to start on the
return journey in two hours. It was nearing
the lunch hour now. They might have dinner
at the outskirts of the white man&rsquo;s land if they
liked.</p>
<p>Their decision was quickly reached. After
a royal feast of white man&rsquo;s food, they bundled
their precious relics of green gold aboard the
plane and, climbing in, sailed away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">[308]</div>
<p>A week later Johnny stood in the doorway
of a cabin. Before the cabin yellow roses
bloomed and the air was laden with the scent
of spring blossoms.</p>
<p>Beside him stood Faye Duncan. No longer
garbed in the dull brown and gray of the
trail, but in a gay red dress, she was the picture
of health and beauty.</p>
<p>Much had been done in these days. A mystery
had been cleared up and a fortune assured.</p>
<p>From Faye&rsquo;s own lips Johnny had learned
the secret of their hiding away in the north
woods so many weeks before. Her grandfather
was to have been a witness in a murder trial.
He believed the man being tried was innocent,
yet he realized that his own testimony would
go far toward convicting him. In order to
avoid being called as a witness and in order
to give time for hot anger to cool and the real
culprit to be found, he had hidden away in
the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">[309]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But now it is all more than right,&rdquo; Faye
had said with tears of joy in her eyes. &ldquo;The
real murderer has confessed; the other man
is free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gordon Duncan had sold half the green
gold for a sum large enough to make him
comfortable for life. Timmie&rsquo;s half he had
given to a museum, there to remain as a
monument to his lost comrade.</p>
<p>Faye and Johnny stood in the doorway
watching the sunset fade. Never before had
Johnny been so tempted to give up the life
of a wanderer and settle down. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Letter for you,&rdquo; said Gordon Duncan.
Coming up the path, he handed it to Johnny.</p>
<p>The boy read the letter with interest. It
was from Curlie Carson. Perhaps you have
read about him. Johnny had heard of him.
In this letter Curlie proposed that the two
of them join in a daring enterprise. Would
Johnny go?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">[310]</div>
<p>Would he? When one frank, daring,
straight shooting adventurer says to another
of his kind, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; the answer is
sure to be, &ldquo;Lead on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; Johnny said to the
ruddy-cheeked Scotch girl as he bade her
goodbye next morning. And who can say he
will not?</p>
<p>If you wish to read of the adventures entered
into by Johnny Thompson and Curlie
Carson, you&rsquo;ll find them all written down in
a book called, &ldquo;The Rope of Gold.&rdquo;</p>
